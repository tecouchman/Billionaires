      <b_desc>His four-year run as world's richest person has come to an end, primarily because shares of Minera Frisco, his mining company, have fallen more than 50% in the past year as the price of gold and copper plummeted. That plus a dip in the value of his largest asset, pan-Latin American telecom firm America Movil, combined to knock $1 billion off his net worth, making him the only billionaire among the world's 10 richest to get poorer in the past year. America Movil has come under pressure in Mexico after the passage of a new anti-monopoly telecom and media law. America Movil has 70% or more market share of both the landline and mobile markets in Mexico. Slim also holds a controlling interest in industrial conglomerate Grupo Carso, financial venture Grupo Financiero Inbursa, real estate enterprise Inmuebles Carso and infrastructure development and operating company Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en América Latina, or Ideal. He continues to hold minority stakes in U.S. companies Saks Fifth Avenue and The New York Times Co. He has also invested in two Spanish companies: Grupo Prisa, a media conglomerate, and CaixaBank, an investment banking firm.</b_desc>

Heinz for $23.2 billion, invested nearly $4 billion in ExxonMobil and a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary bought Nevada's NV Energy for $5.6 billion. All of this helped boost his fortune by $4.7 billion despite his gift of $2 billion in Berkshire stock to the Gates Foundation in July, bringing his lifetime giving to $20 billion. Secret to his success? In his investment letter in 2014, he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders his best investment wasn't a stock or business, it was buying Benjamin Graham's book</b_desc>

He is up a total of $26.5 billion in the past two years. Though he stepped down as chairman of Inditex (best known for its Zara brand) in 2011, he still owns nearly 60% of its shares. He also has a growing real estate portfolio, estimated to be worth nearly $5 billion, much of it acquired at bargain prices during the financial downturn. He is reportedly planning to list his property holdings in a real estate investment trust. Among his properties: the iconic Torre Picasso, a 43-story skyscraper in Madrid (Google is a tenant). In the past year, he's bought four new buildings in Madrid, New York and London for around $830 million, taking the number of buildings he owns to 26. A railway worker's son, he started as a gofer in a shirt store. With then-wife Rosalia Mera, now deceased, he started making dressing gowns and lingerie in their living room. They had a daughter Sandra, and a son, Marcos. Ortega is now married to Flora Perez Marcote, with whom he had another daughter, Marta.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Walton is the richest woman in the world once again, taking back the title from L'Oreal Heiress Liliane Bettencourt. She has now held that title for 4 out of the last 5 years. She inherited her wealth when husband John Walton, a former Green Beret and Vietnam war medic, died in an airplane crash in 2005. John's side investment in First Solar had boosted Christy's net worth well above the rest of her family, but the stock sank in 2011, narrowing her lead. But First Solar stock has revived, up 47% in past year and boosting her net worth by $466 million. The bulk of her holdings are in Wal-Mart, the massive retailer founded by her father-in-law Sam Walton and his brother James in 1962. Christy received $460 million in Wal-Mart dividends after taxes in 2013. She leads a very private life in Jackson, Wyoming, but in August had a rare bit of publicity when she was given an award by the Imagen Foundation for producing the film</b_desc>

      <b_desc>L'Oreal's grand dame Liliane Bettencourt is no longer the world's richest woman, though she grew wealthier this year thanks to the French cosmetics giant's stock price, up 9% since 2013. Bettencourt is no longer involved in running the company her father founded after a 2011 legal battle with daughter Françoise Bettencourt Meyers proved Liliane was unfit to manage her affairs. The elderly widow, who suffers from dementia, was replaced on the company's board by her 25-year-old grandson Jean-Victor Meyers in February 2012. The Bettencourt family is set to strengthen its hold on the L'Oreal empire in 2014 thanks to Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle's planned sale of its 8% stake. That will raise the family's holdings to 33%.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Wal-Mart heir S. Robson Walton, chairman of the company and eldest son of visionary retailer Sam, has had a rocky year -- in the press, anyway. In late summer, employees organized protests against low wages in 15 cities across the U.S. And, responding to Wal-Mart's involvement in a bribery scandal in Mexico and a calamitous factory collapse in Bangladesh, a group of stock owners opposed Walton, who has been company chairman since 1992, and several other board members at the 2013 annual shareholders meeting. But financially, the world's largest retailer remains steady. Founded by Sam and his brother James in 1962 in Rodgers, Ark., Wal-Mart boasts sales of nearly $470 billion and employs nearly 2.2 million people in 11,000 stores worldwide. Rob received about $465 million in dividends in 2013. He also owns a $500 million stake in Hyatt Hotels through an investment vehicle. Before joining Wal-Mart, he was a partner with the law firm of Conner &amp; Winters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 2012 he reportedly wrecked his Shelby Daytona Cobra Coupe -- one of only five made and worth at least $15 million -- when he drove it off a racing track.</b_desc>

The richest person in Asia, he could be a lot wealthier if he so chose. The reason: Li is probably the only person on earth who invested in Facebook as a high-stakes hobby and made no money from it. Li bet on Facebook, a decision he says took him five minutes to make in December 2007, through his charitable Li Ka Shing Foundation. In fact, all of his tech bets, whether in Spotify, Siri, or more recently Bitcoin payment service provider, BitPay, benefit the foundation, not him. Still his stakes in Hutchinson Whampoa, Cheung Kong and Husky Energy, plus rich dividends of $1.7 billion in just the past two years, allow him to hold onto the top spot in his region. Born in Chaozhou in China's Guangdong Province, Li and his family had to flee to Hong Kong during the Sino-Japanese war. Not long after their arrival Li's father, who had been a primary school principal in China, died from tuberculosis. At age 12 he quit school and started as an apprentice in a watch-strap factory. By 14 he was working full-time in a plastics trading company to help support his family. In 1950 Li quit to start his own business making plastic toys and everyday items. He retooled his factory to focus on plastic flowers after learning about their popularity in Italy from trade journals, figuring they offered him better business prospects. He named his first company Cheung Kong, after the Yangtze River, whose power comes from a confluence of countless smaller streams.</b_desc>

Shareholders seem happy. The search giant's stock continues to trade at record highs, up about 50% year-over-year as of mid-Feb. 2014. That's caused the net worth of co-founders Page and Sergey Brin to surge past $30 billion for the first time.

He battled with Michael Dell, helped push Aubrey McClendon out of Chesapeake Energy, made a killer trade on Netflix, fought with William Ackman over Herbalife, and loudly lobbied for Apple to repurchase more of its stock. Shares of his publicly-trade Icahn Enterprises have soared by more than 50% in the last year. Icahn's investment fund returned 31% in 2013. Icahn's brand of activist investing is as popular as ever. In August 2013, Icahn took to Twitter, setting both the Web and Wall Street on fire by announcing that he had acquired a large stake in Apple.</b_desc>

That was not good enough to beat the U.S. stock market, but it still made Soros a lot of money. Soros is not involved in the day-to-day operations of Soros Fund Management, the $29 billion family office that manages Soros' fortune and money contributed to his foundations. The firm is overseen by Scott Bessent, Soros Fund Management's chief investment officer, but Soros remains involved and the firm's big short bet of the yen at the start of 2013 was vintage Soros.

Because of the small float, the lack of any analyst coverage and the relatively thin trading of Kingdom Holding, Forbes estimated Alwaleed's net worth by calculating the value of the assets owned by Kingdom Holding rather than using its share price. Holdings include stakes in News Corp, Citigroup, hotel management companies Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, Movenpick Hotels &amp; Resorts and Fairmont Raffles Holding, as well as hotel real estate such as the swanky Hotel George V in Paris and a stake in the Savoy Hotel in London. In 2012, the Prince and his investment company bought $300 million worth of Twitter shares; they're now worth upwards of $1 billion. Kingdom Holding could also benefit from a $125 million investment it made in Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, which filed to raise $1.5 billion in an IPO in January. He also owns extensive Saudi real estate and other assets outside of Kingdom Holding. In 2013, Prince Alwaleed sued Forbes for libel in response to an article about him. Forbes stands by our position that the Prince does not have a valid claim and Forbes is preparing a formal response to the complaint.</b_desc>

He has now invested in three web-based music streaming companies, France's Deezer, Daniel Ek's Spotify, and the newly formed Beats Music, in which he led a $60 million financing round. Blavatnik bought Warner Music in 2011 for $3.3 billion and has been adding assets, including artists like Coldplay, Pink Floyd, and David Guetta with the acquisition of Parlophone in July, which helped the record label narrow losses and grow revenue. While Blavatnik continues to expand his media holdings, having invested $115 million for a spectrum play in Norway and $400 million in German incubator Rocket Internet in 2013, he remains close to his industrialist roots. The bulk of his fortune is derived from his stake in publicly traded chemicals giant LyondellBasell, which continues to make record highs. Blavatnik was born in Ukraine and emigrated to the U.S. in 1978, ultimately earning degrees from Columbia University and Harvard Business School. Already as an American citizen, Blavatnik made timely investment in post-Soviet aluminum and energy companies, endured the bankruptcy of LyondellBasell, a merger he engineered, and then expanded into media and communications. He hosts an annual lunch on his yacht during the Cannes Film Festival with Harvey Weinstein, and is interested in philanthropy; in 2010 he donated $117 million to Oxford University to build the Blavatnik School of Government, while last year he pledged $30 million to fund young scientists and keep innovation in the U.S.</b_desc>

Schwarz regularly appeared on Forbes' annual billionaires ranking in the 1990s but was taken off the list in 1999 after making the case to Forbes that he had transferred his ownership of Lidl to a charitable foundation. He returned to the list in 2013, after research showed that the Dieter Schwarz Foundation is a limited liability company with a charitable purpose, not a charitable foundation. Dividends are used to fund charitable projects, but Schwarz maintains full control over his shares and can sell them at any time (in which case he would have to pay taxes on the dividend distributions). The Schwarz Foundation supports education and daycare facilities for children. A deeply private person who shuns all publicity, Schwarz is married with two children.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Crate and Barrel enjoys excellent name recognition in the U.S., but few shoppers at the furnishings and home accessories retailer know of its sprawling German parent, Otto Group, which bills itself as the second largest Internet retailer worldwide (after Amazon.com). Founded by the late Werner Otto in Hamburg, in 1949, the family company is active in real estate and financial services as well as retail. Werner's son Michael, who heads the supervisory board, retired as chief executive in 2007 after 26 years in that position. (An environmentalist, he supports a foundation that funds the preservation of Germany's Elbe river.) In October, his son Benjamin joined the Otto Group in an e-commerce capacity. Michael's brother Alexander manages the family's ECE Group, which develops and manages shopping centers (at last count, 189 were under management). It also develops and builds transport complexes, logistics centers, company headquarters, office complexes, industrial buildings and special-purpose properties. With an estimated value of $9 billion, ECE represents about half of the family's fortune. Then there's Paramount Investment Group, an asset manager for closed-end funds that own 18 prime office properties in New York City, Washington D.C. and San Francisco, representing a total of 14.25 million square feet of space. Estimated value of the Ottos' stake: $2 billion. Another family entity manages roughly 8,300 apartments and 1.5 million square feet of industrial space in the Toronto area. Rounding out the portfolio are retail and service businesses, including the world's largest mail-order company, under the umbrella of Otto GmbH &amp; Co. Family members can look back on the fiscal year ending in February 2013 with a sense of satisfaction, if not relief: Profits rebounded to Eu 144 million ($196 million) after having plunged to Eu 23 million ($31 million) the year before. Also sharing in the fortune: Maren Otto, the third wife of Werner, and her daughter Katharina Otto-Bernstein.</b_desc>

Ergen denies the allegations, and the dispute remains before a judge. Although Dish Network and Echostar, the two companies Ergen controls, still enjoy solid profitability, he foresees a day when consumers will get all their video content over the Internet or through high-speed mobile, and is struggling to remake his empire to prepare.

      <b_desc>In February 2014 Vladimir Potanin divorced his wife Natalia, who has reportedly filed a series of subpoenas to gather information about his assets. He has already agreed to pay her $240,000 a month in alimony. The couple have a 13-year-old son. With fellow billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, he built Interros, one of Russia's largest private investment companies, starting in 1992, by winning over the corporate customers of two huge Soviet-era banks. The two later took control of metals giant Norilsk Nickel and oil company Sidanco in controversial loans-for-shares privatization auctions. Potanin split from Prokhorov beginning in early 2007; he is now the sole owner of Interros. During the financial crisis of 2008 he sold off assets including his stake in giant gold producer Polyus Gold. In 2013 he sold a portion of his stake in Norilsk Nickel. He also sold Russia's biggest private media holding company, ProfMedia, to quasi-state-owned Gazprom Media. He has served as a deputy prime minister of the economy and as a partner to billionaire George Soros in the telecom monopoly Svyazinvest. He funded the construction of a $2.6 billion Russian ski resort, Rosa Khutor, which hosted the skiing and snowboarding events for the Olympic Games in Sochi. In February 2013, he became the first Russian billionaire to join the Bill Gates-Warren Buffett Giving Pledge, promising to give away at least half of his fortune.</b_desc>

In November, Rupert reached a divorce settlement with Wendi, with whom he was married for 14 years and has two daughters. The couple reportedly had a pre-nuptial agreement and two postnups, which led to Wendi keeping their 5th Avenue apartment; the settlement didn't affect Murdoch's ownership of his media companies. The other major split had to do with News Corporation, which was split into two publicly traded entities: 21st Century Fox, which holds mainly TV and film properties, and News Corp, which was left with the newspaper and book publishing units. Both stocks kept pace with the broader U.S. stock market, which had an impressive 2013, helping to boost Murdoch's net worth by more than $2 billion in the past year.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>The stereotype of financially conservative Germans having an aversion to leverage doesn't apply to Georg Schaeffler and his mother, Maria-Elisabeth, proprietors of INA Waelzlager Schaeffler KG, one of world's largest producers of roller bearings and machine components. In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, Schaeffler Group owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, the Schaefflers have continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen by more than 14-fold. Schaeffler Group now owns 36% of the company, a stake worth around $16 billion. Maria-Elisabeth took the helm of Schaeffler Group following the death of her husband, also named Georg, in 1996. Along with his brother Wilhelm (d. 1981), he founded the company in 1946, first making wooden spoons, clothespins and rakes. Son Georg, who practiced international business law in Dallas, has been at his mother's side helping to run the business since 2009. Now chairman of INA's supervisory board, he owns 80% of Schaeffler Group to Maria-Elisabeth's 20%.</b_desc>

The stake is now worth nearly $10 billion, about $1 billion less than in early 2013 due to a drop in the SABMiller stock price. It is the largest piece in a wide portfolio of companies that make up the privately held Santo Domingo Group.

Despite big moves, Sy's fortune dropped by $1.8 billion mainly because shares of his holding firm SM Investments tumbled 30% in the past year. They took a hit when the company sold some shares to institutional investors at a discount to market price. Son Henry Sy Jr chairs SM Prime, while son Hans is group president.</b_desc>

SAC Capital, based in Stamford, Ct., pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges in 2013 and agreed to pay $1.8 billion in fines and penalties to the federal government. As of the end of February, the $1.8 billion of fines and penalties remained tied up in court proceedings and had not yet been paid by SAC Capital to the federal government, leaving Cohen's net worth inflated. Also in recent months, federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained two more convictions of former SAC Capital employees. But through these difficult times, Cohen has continued to do what he does best, make profitable trades and earn lots of money. SAC Capital knocked out net returns of about 19% in 2013.

At the time Perrodo was traveling the world drilling for oil and gas. Soon they got married. Sharing the entrepreneurial bug, Carrie launched her own agency, Carrie's Models, while Hubert started his first business. In time Perrodo formed Perenco, which has become one of the world's biggest family-owned oil companies with estimated annual revenues of $6 billion and far-flung operations in the likes of Gabon, Peru and Nigeria. Hubert and Carrie enjoyed the good life; he was a keen polo player and wine lover who bought up Bordeaux vineyards including Chateau Labegorce. Perrodo died in 2006 while hiking in the Alps. It's still unclear whether Hubert's estate has finally been settled, but because he owned all of Perenco, the fortune is expected to be passed down entirely to Carrie and their three children Francois, Nathalie and Bertrand. Francois now chairs the company and likes to race cars. Nathalie oversees the wine investments. Though French nationals, the family operates out of London. Carrie sold Carrie's Models years ago, but the agency remains active to this day.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Mikhail Prokhorov has been, by turns, banker, athlete, metals mogul, playboy, investor, media player, politician, NBA owner (the Brooklyn Nets) and now, again, politician. He rocked Russia when he jumped into its 2012 presidential race against strongman Vladimir Putin. No one expected him to win but he managed to get 8% of the vote, even though he ran an unexceptional campaign. (He did, however, rap on TV, perhaps suggesting that some of his friendship with Jay-Z is rubbing off). While the 6-foot-8-inch bachelor and martial arts enthusiast moved the Nets to a new arena in Brooklyn's Atlantic Yards, and often jets in to watch a game, he has no plans to settle in the U.S. He insists that his serious interest is Russian politics, and he has created a new party, the Civic Platform, that he intends to expand until it's strong enough to go head-to-head with Putin's United Russia. He has the money to see it through. In late February 2013 he sold his 37.8% share of Polyus Gold International Ltd. for $3.6 billion. He's still in acquisition mode. In December 2013 he bought a 27% stake in Uralkali, the world's biggest producer of potassium fertilizers, from billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and other shareholders.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Klaus Michael Kuehne, now 76, joined his grandfather's transportation and logistics company, Kuehne &amp; Nagel, in 1963 and became CEO three years later. Through a holding company, he has 53% of publicly traded Kuehne und Nagel International AG, which has 63.000 employees in more than 100 countries. Having stepped back as Chairman of the Executive Committee, he now serves as Honorary Chairman. In 2008, in an effort to keep the company anchored in Germany, Kuehne and a group of investors that included the city of Hamburg formed the Albert Ballin KG consortium to bid for 160-year-old Hapag Lloyd, one of the world's leading container ship operators. (Michael Kuehne now holds a 28.2% stake. The company plans a public share offering in 2014.) A resident of Switzerland, he still maintains ties to his birthplace, Hamburg -- having helped fund the soccer club Hamburg SV, which has spent lavishly to obtain top players. In 2003, in partnership with the city of Hamburg and the technical University of Hamburg, he founded what is now called Hamburg School of Logistics. Now called Kuehne Logistics University, it is supported by a charitable foundation originally formed by Kuehne and his parents in 1976. In September Kuehne pledged $54 million to the university over the next 5 years. He also supports the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) and Technical University of Berlin. In Mallorca, Kuehne has transformed a 600-year-old castle, Castell Son Claret, into to a hotel (it opened in May 2013). In early 2013 he acquired the insolvent InterContinental in Hamburg; it will be demolished to make way for a new, $175 million hotel, The Fontenay (anticipated opening: July 2016).</b_desc>

Under his watch shares in the bank are up average 13% a year ever since, and his stake is now worth $2.7 billion. Ask Kaiser what happened with Solyndra -- the solar company he backed that failed after receiving hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds -- and he chalks it up to competition from low-cost solar gear from Chinese companies that got even more handouts from their government. It's too bad that his Solyndra investment garnered Kaiser more attention than anything else he's ever done. The Tulsa tycoon deserves to be better known for his $3 billion George Kaiser Family Foundation, which doles out more than $40 million a year -- most of it for early childhood education. Kaiser's family fled Nazi Germany and settled in Tulsa, where his uncle founded Kaiser-Francis Oil Company. George inherited control in the late 1960s. He's now pursuing oil plays in North Dakota, Wyoming and Canada. Kaiser also founded Excelerate Energy, which ships liquefied natural gas around the world. Other assets include a large number of private equity investments, including printer company Memjet, hypoallergenic latex maker Yulex, and a stake in India's Bombay Stock Exchange.</b_desc>

The company aims to revolutionize medicine by adding big data to patient care. He believes that if doctors have the most updated and complete information about their patients, they'll make more informed treatment decisions. At Nantworks' core is a 12,000-mile fiber data network and algorithms that, among other things, can analyze the data contained in a human genome in 47 seconds. An increased valuation of Nantworks through additional investment rounds has pushed Soon-Shiong's fortune up by a third since September 2013. In addition to Nantworks, Soon-Shiong is developing two cancer drugs. The son of a village doctor in China, his family moved to South Africa during World War II. He graduated high school by 16 and became a doctor at 23. He made a name for himself in the 1980s as a transplant surgeon, then developed the cancer drug Abraxane. He also started two drug companies, American Pharmaceutical Partners and Abraxis, before selling both for a major pay day. As a member of the Buffett-Gates Giving Pledge, he plans to give away at least half his fortune.</b_desc>

A former nuclear engineer, he turned his family's ailing Naples pharmaceutical wholesaler into Alliance UniChem Group, which merged with the U.K. pharmacy chain Boots Group in 2006 to form Alliance Boots. The following year Alliance Boots went private in a $22 billion deal with financing from private equity firm KKR, still Europe's largest leveraged buyout. A British charity and U.S. labor group complained Pessina dodged $1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) in taxes during the deal, but he denies the accusations. In mid 2012 Walgreen bought 45% of Alliance Boots for $6.7 billion in cash and shares. Walgreen has the option to buy the other 55% by next year. If the deal goes through, Pessina will get another $2.8 billion in Walgreen shares, plus $1.7 billion (£1 billion) in cash. Some Walgreen stakeholders fear he will own too much of the company and are trying to restrict his power. He lives in Monaco.</b_desc>

The other part of Kirkbi is equally famous: the toy company LEGO. (Kristiansen is the grandson of the company's founder.) LEGO moved ahead of Hasbro in 2013 to become the second largest toy company by sales; it has long been the most profitable. The increase in sales comes from the success of movie tie-ins with Star Wars and Marvel, while LEGO hopes its new Friends line will make inroads with little girls. Creating Star Wars toys was actually dreamed up by Kristiansen during his quarter-century tenure as CEO. He stepped down in 2004 and remains deputy chairman and the company's majority owner.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Dmitry Rybolovlev is best known in the U.S. for his real estate moves. He bought Donald Trump's Palm Beach mansion, Maison de L'Amitie, for $95 million in 2008. He also apparently paid more than $300 million for La Belle Epoque penthouse in Monaco, where he lives. (His daughter Ekaterina bought Skorpios, the Greek island that belonged to successors of Aristotle Onassis, in 2013 and owns an NYC apartment, for which she paid $88 million). Rybolovlev (and his family) have all this money to spend after having sold his stake in Uralkali, the fertilizer business that made him rich, for $6.5 billion in 2010.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Giorgio Armani's private Armani Group continues to post huge growth numbers, making the Italian fashion mogul richer every year despite Europe's economic struggles. Sales for Armani Group were up more than 15% in 2012, boosting Armani's personal net worth by $1.2 billion (900 million euros). Much of the company's growth comes from China, where its sales grew by more than a third in 2012. But even in Europe, the group managed to grow by double digits. Armani also owns a 4.9% stake worth $1.2 billion (890 million euros) in eyeglasses manufacturer Luxottica. He partnered with Dubai developer Emaar Properties to build two luxury hotels, one in Milan and another in Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. He owns 10 houses, five in Italy alone, and a $50 million yacht.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Red Bull is the leading brand in a frothy energy drinks market, with company sales up an impressive 16% in 2012 to Eu 4.93 billion ($6.7 billion) -- boosting co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz's net worth by an estimated $2.1 billion. Born in Styria, Austria to a family of Croatian ancestry, Mateschitz marketed detergents for Unilever and toothpaste for German cosmetics company Blendax. It was during his travels for Blendax that he discovered Krating Daeng, the drink that would become Red Bull. In 1984, he founded Red Bull GmbH with Thailand's Chalerm Yoovidhya, who died in March 2012. A Taurus (the zodiac sign of the bull), Mateschitz owns 49% of the company, which sold 5.23 billion cans of Red Bull worldwide in 2012 -- with eye-popping revenue gains in South Africa (+52%), Japan (+51%) and Saudi Arabia (+38%). (China, alas, remains unconquered territory.) Mateschitz and his team excel at highly publicized marketing stunts. In October 2012, he financed a team supporting the Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who broke a record with a supersonic freefall jump from 24 miles above the earth. However, because of its contents, Red Bull is still banned in Iceland and Uruguay. The company has stakes in two soccer teams, Red Bull Salzburg and the New York Red Bulls, and a Formula One team, Red Bull Racing. Mateschitz's other interests include Seitenblicke magazine; Servus TV; a luxury resort on the island of Laucala in Fiji; and Hangar-7, the event center on the grounds of the Salzburg airport that houses his historical aircraft collection, the Flying Bulls.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>EBay founder Pierre Omidyar is expanding into other ventures nearly 20 years after founding his online auction company. Outspoken on Twitter, he created First Look Media, a group that aims to present new forms of independent journalism. It's first publication, digital magazine The Intercept, launched in Feb. 2014, featuring work from Edward Snowden-revealing journalist Glenn Greenwald. The site will initially focus on disclosing new information from NSA whistleblower Snowden. Still serving as eBay's chairman, Omidyar also spends time on the Omidyar Network, his philanthropic investment firm. A member of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's Giving Pledge, Omidyar and his wife, Pam, have been perhaps the biggest private donors to the fight against human trafficking over the last half decade. In the past four years, they've invested $115 million in their Humanity United foundation, which funds 85 antislavery nonprofits as well as on-the-ground projects in five countries, including their first in Nepal. They've pledged to spend another $50 million by 2016. Born in France of Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the U.S. with his family at age 6. He wrote code for his website, Auction Web, at age 28 and renamed it eBay after his first choice, Echo Bay, was already taken. Omidyar ceded executive control to new hire Meg Whitman in 1998; she was replaced by John Donahoe 10 years later. He continues to gift away large swaths of his eBay shares, including a large 9.6 million share donation to his foundation in Aug. 2013.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>The fortune of Sweden's richest woman, Antonia Johnson, took a hit this year as the warmest winter in 30 years drastically cut heating fuel sales, driving down earnings by 30% at industrial products company Axel Johnson Inc. The company is a subsidiary of her Axel Johnson Group. She succeeded her father as head of the privately held, diversified trading company in 1982. Founded by her great-grandfather in 1873, it has interests in security, energy, telecom, real estate and industrial products. It also holds a 50% stake in Axfood AB, one of the largest food companies in Scandinavia. Johnson went to Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA, as an exchange student in the early 1960s. She is an avid horsewoman and member of numerous Swedish charities, including the World Childhood Foundation, which was founded by the Swedish queen.</b_desc>

Last year was a tough one for Deripaska's giant aluminum maker, UC Rusal. As aluminum prices dropped its market cap fell by 44%. In late December 2013 the company sued London Metal Exchange in a dispute over rules for the aluminum trade, which could result in further losses. A former metals trader, he came back from the brink of collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Facing margin calls and billions of dollars in debt, he personally negotiated with the Russian government, banks and other creditors to restructure his loan obligations. He managed to defend the majority of his assets from creditors, including car maker Gaz and power producer EuroSibEnergo. In 2010 Rusal raised $2.2 billion in a Hong Kong IPO. In preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Deripaska funded construction of the site's main road, seaport, airport and the Olympic Village. He also donated $15,000 to construct a shelter, PovoDog, to take in some of the many strays in the area that were being exterminated. He has pledged $50,000 to keep the shelter running for a year.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Despite eye-watering debt levels, New Zealand's richest person is up more than $2 billion since last year. Most of the gain is thanks to his global packaging empire, Reynolds Group Holdings, which now has annual revenue of about $14 billion after a string of big acquisitions in the past few years. The low-profile Hart also owns Carter Holt Harvey, an Australasian paper, packing and building supplies company, and the US-based UCI-FRAM group, which controls several major automobile components brands. Over the years, Hart's umbrella private investment holding company, Rank Group, has used leveraged buyouts to swallow underperforming businesses that produce goods needed by people every day, including trash bags, milk cartons, water bottles, paper and foil. He left school at 16.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Indian telecom tycoon Sunil Mittal saw his wealth decline by $1.1 billion despite big moves to cement his Bharti Airtel's position as India's biggest mobile operator with 200 million domestic customers. In a recent government auction, he bought additional telecom spectrum worth close to $3 billion. In February, he inked a $113 million deal to acquire smaller rival Loop Mobile to become the largest player in Mumbai city. Last year, he signed an infrastructure sharing pact with potential rival Reliance Jio Infocomm, Mukesh Ambani's new telecom venture. Bharti Airtel recently faced a setback in Africa when a Lagos court ruled against it in an ownership dispute involving its Nigerian unit. Mittal was also was in the news last year for breaking off with Wal-Mart, his partner in a six-year old joint venture that was troubled by allegations of wrongdoing. The U.S. retailer took over the wholesale business while he continues to own a separate chain of grocery stores, for which he hired the former head of Wal-Mart India. Mittal is due to appear in court in an ongoing case involving granting of additional telecom spectrum.</b_desc>

The brothers also own a controlling stake in Infoglobo, Brazil's biggest newspaper company, which publishes O Globo, one of the country's most influential daily newspapers. The O Globo newspaper was founded in 1925 by their grandfather, Irineu Marinho; he died shortly thereafter and their father Roberto Marinho took over. In 1965 their father launched the Globo TV network. Globo had net income in 2013 of $1.1 billoin (R$2.5 billion), a drop from $1.4 billion (R$2.95 billion) in the previous year. In July 2013 protesters marching against corruption and the cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup also expressed anger at the media empire, which had sold all its broadcast sponsorship packages for the World Cup in a deal valued at more than $1 billion. Roberto Irineu, the oldest sibling, is the company's chief executive officer. He also owns Sertaozinho Farm, which produces Orfeu gourmet coffee.

He retired from the SAP board in 2005. The following year, he transferred nearly three-quarters of his 10% stake in SAP into a limited liability company with a charitable purpose; his Dietmar Hopp Stiftung supports sports, medicine, education and social programs. Forbes counts the SAP shares in the Dietmar Hopp Stiftung towards Hopp's net worth because he controls them and can sell them at any time (though the dividends must be used for a charitable purpose to avoid tax liability).

Since its start in 1905, the Knorr-Bremse's revenue has increased 30-fold, to Eu 4.3 billion ($5.84 billion) in 2013. It has more than 19,000 employees in 90 locations. Having withdrawn from his position on the operational side of the business in 2007, Thiele, age 72, now sits on the supervisory board. He has given a portion of the company to his two children, Henrik and Julia. In early 2011, Thiele started investing in quoted German railroad equipment maker Vossloh (he now holds a 25% stake). In 2013, against the wishes of the Vossloh family, he drew enough votes to become head of Vossloh's advisory board. Thiele is said to enjoy hiking, skiing and animal photography.

      <b_desc>Silicon Valley icon Gordon Moore spent the better part of his life creating and running two of the nation's most influential technology companies. He cofounded Fairchild Semiconductor, then broke off from the company to start chipmaker Intel in 1968. There, he served as chief executive until 1987 and chairman until 1997. Today, the namesake behind Moore's Law--which posits that computing power will double every two years--spends most of his time focusing on philanthropic work, especially after stepping down from the board of Gilead Sciences this year. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation was created in 2001 with a donation of his 175 million Intel shares; the foundation now has more than $5.3 billion in assets. It awards about $250 million each year to support sustainability, environmental conservation, healthcare and scientific research. Last year the foundation announced its Patient Care Program with a $500 million commitment over 10 years for grants to promote innovation in patient care. The foundation is the largest backer of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the world's largest, under construction in Hawaii. It has contributed more than $50 million for the design and in 2007 pledged $200 million over nine years for the telescope's construction. Recently the Moore's personally gifted $50 million to the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center at Mission Bay. Moore studied chemistry at U.C. Berkeley and earned a Ph.D. in chemistry and physics from the California Institute of Technology, where he is a life trustee.</b_desc>

Striking out on his own in 1974, Graf began importing American pinball machines to Austria via Belgium, then became an agent for a British slot machine company. When electronic machines came on the scene, he found a niche as a servicing specialist -- hiring qualified technicians and developing the expertise that led to the founding, in 1980, of Novomatic Automatenhandels AG, which introduced the Admiral line of gaming machines. Graf quickly expanded his geographic reach, entering the Swiss market in 1982 and the East Bloc after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Offing slots, video poker, video lottery, multiplayer games and electronic table games, Novomatic has thrived in a market hungry for innovation, which also pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy. The group, which includes two Swiss affiliates -- ACE Casino Holding AG and Gryphon Invest AG -- currently has offices in more than 43 countries and exports high-tech gaming equipment to more than 80 countries. It also operates casinos, from Berlin to Santiago de Chile, and is a major player in the online and mobile gaming segments. In 2012, net profit from ordinary activities rose by 9.1% to Eu 359 million ($488 million) on revenue of Eu 3.2 billion ($4.35 billion). Going forward, Novomatic could face challenges close to home as an Austrian court recently rule that the action button on some of its machines are in contravention of the law. The verdict is not final.Graf's eldest son, Thomas, heads the technology end of the business and serves on Novomatic AG's management board.

Filings with the SEC from February 2014 show that he has succession agreements with the CEOs of Liberty Global and Discovery Communications. The CEOs have the right of first refusal on his stakes and can vote his shares if Malone is unable, though Malone has stated that he has no plans to step down. He is the chairman of both companies. In January 2014 Charter Communications (owned in part by Malone's Liberty Media) tried to buy Time Warner Cable but the company was sold instead to Comcast. Liberty Media bought a 27% stake in Charter Communications in May 2013, putting Malone back in the cable TV business. He sold TCI cable, then the nation's largest cable company, to AT&amp;T in 1999 for $54 billion. Other deals in 2013 included Liberty Global's acquisition of British cable company Virgin Media in June, Liberty Media's spin-off of its Starz Entertainment group as a separate company, and the FCC-approved takeover of Sirius XM Radio by Liberty Media. Liberty Media also owns stakes in event producer Live Nation and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.

      <b_desc>Founder of $8.7 billion (revenues) Adani Group, country's biggest port operator, Gautam Adani has continued to face headwinds. In January, the Gujarat High Court in his home state, ordered a dozen industrial units in Adani's special economic zone to be shut down for not getting environment clearances. He appealed to India's Supreme Court which subsequently allowed them to restart. The directorate of revenue intelligence is reportedly investigating the alleged over-invoicing of parts by Adani's power unit. Adani, who is said to be close to Narendra Modi, Gujarat's chief minister and the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has denied any wrongdoing. In the meantime, he's close to sealing a deal to buy a port jointly owned by the Tata Group and engineering firm Larsen &amp; Toubro for around $800 million.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green is a high-school dropout. At age 27 he bought his first London store where he sold discounted designer brands. In 2000 he bought British Home Stores in a leveraged buyout and turned the chain around. Two years later he bought retail group Arcadia for $1.2 billion. Arcadia owns Topshop, Topman, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, and Miss Selfridge. In 2012 he sold 25% of the Topshop empire to J. Crew investor Leonard Green &amp; Partners, for $763 million, valuing his fashion chain at $3 billion. In November 2013 Green announced plans for BHS to open convenience food outlets, challenging Marks and Spencer, the U.K. retailer that rejected his takeover bid in 2005. He keeps his money offshore in investment vehicle Taveta which he shares with his wife Cristina. He commutes from Monaco to London in a private jet and is known for his lavish parties. In 2005 he reportedly paid Andrea Bocelli and Beyonce to play at his son Brandon's three-day bar mitzvah celebration. He is a business partner with supermodel Kate Moss and reality TV star Kim Kardashian.</b_desc>

Bertelli and Miuccia are embroiled in a tax evasion investigation according to reports in Italyian daily Corriere della Sera. In January lawyers for Prada denied knowledge of any tax probe.

      <b_desc>After the death of Adolf Merckle in 2009, at age 74, his son Ludwig took the helm of an empire mired in crisis and debt. The downward spiral had come about unexpectedly, after secretive Adolf -- once one of Germany's wealthiest men -- took a hit due to the 2008 financial crisis. He had taken out a loan to recapitalize HeidelbergCement, and used shares he owned in the cement company as collateral. When Heidelberg stock lost 75% of its value, the banks demanded early repayment of the loan. In the wake of this, Adolph committed suicide. Ludwig has since restructured the group and executed an impressive turnaround. In the fall of 2009, he unloaded shares of HeidelbergCement, cutting his stake from 74% to 25%. The following year, he sold generic drug maker Ratiopharm to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion. It looked as if Phoenix Group might have to go on the block as well, given the extent of the liabilities Adolf had assumed in assembling the drug wholesaler through acquisitions, but the company was saved when banks came through with an Eu 2.6 billion syndicated loan facility. Now Phoenix is deleveraging and on the rebound. Shares of HeidelbergCement, meanwhile, have risen in value.

It was a seminal lesson in risk management. He founded hedge fund firm Caxton Associates in 1983 and generated more than $12 billion in net gains for investors during his career. Kovner handed the reins to Caxton to his former chief investment officer Andrew Law on January 1, 2012, though he retains an ownership stake in the management company. That same month Kovner gave $20 million to Julliard, where he is chairman; he has also donated nearly 140 scores and sketches by composers such as Bach, Beethoven and Brahms to the school.

      <b_desc>Frederick Paulsen is new to the Forbes Billionaires list this year. He inherited small drugmaker Ferring Pharmaceuticals, founded by his father founded sixty years ago. When he began running the business in 1983, it generated $15 million in revenue annually. Today the biotech outfit, which makes infertility, obstetrics, urology, gastroenterology and endocrinology products, has estimated sales of $1.7 billion. In 1998 he began underwriting philanthropic projects around the world while simultaneously exploring its far corners. One eccentric $10 million effort involves using machines mounted on helicopters to sprinkle blood-thinning poison across farms and fields to kill off the rats on South Georgia, a remote island with a population of 30 in the southeast of the Falklands. He is also building fertility clinics in Russia, one every two years, to help reverse its drastic population decline. He gave the kingdom of Bhutan more than $3 million and a big collection of tapestries to bolster its new Royal Textile Academy. Paulsen makes three or four extreme adventure trips a year, some lasting as long as 40 days. He was the first person to cross the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia in an ultralight aircraft, which is little more than a lawn chair attached to a kite and propeller.</b_desc>

KKR, which has $95 billion in assets under management, recorded $691 million in net profit in 2013, a 23% increase from 2012. Its shares rose more than 30% in the past year. Notable investments include domain name vendor Go Daddy Group and Toys R Us. The company made headlines in May 2013 after hiring scandal-tarnished former CIA director and retired general David Petraeus as chairman of a new team focusing on global economic trends and government policies. KKR was one of the first firms to use leverage in acquisitions. Kravis and his economist wife Marie-Josée are also among the most preeminent Americans in art collecting. He has a wing named after him at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Marie-Josée is president of the Museum of Modern Art's board of trustees.

The decision to cede control to real estate veteran Rob Hollister marks the first time a nonfamily member will run the 35-year-old company. Father and son said they would focus on the family's philanthropic work through their Sobrato Family Foundation. Sobrato Organization was founded by the elder Sobrato in 1978 and currently owns about 7.5 million square feet of commercial office space and 30 apartment communities with 6,700 units along the west coast. Commercial tenants include Apple, Yahoo and Netflix. John A. Sobrato began his real estate career in 1957, selling homes in Palo Alto while going to school at Santa Clara University. He built up a commercial real estate empire in the 1960s and 1970s with fellow Silicon Valley builder and former Forbes 400 member, Carl Berg. Sobrato, through his foundation, has donated more than $230 million in real estate and cash to local communities since 1996. In January, he and his wife made a $5 million donation to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. The couple has signed on to Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge.</b_desc>

While rivals like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group snap up foreclosures, Zell says he's skeptical of turning single-family real estate investments into long-term operating companies. Nicknamed the Grave Dancer for his ability to profit from distressed-asset investing, Zell's empire includes stakes in sectors as diverse as hospitality, energy, transportation, finance, healthcare and communications. He is chairman of four publicly traded corporations and through his core firm Equity Group Investments has cleaned up an array of distressed private and public companies over the years. Meanwhile, he has expanded abroad via emerging markets fund Equity International, which has raised an estimated $2 billion to invest in homebuilder and real estate-related companies in Brazil, Colombia, India, China and Mexico, among others. Zell is considered one of the fathers of the REIT industry, having co-founded three of the largest publicly traded real estate investment trusts in history. Last year his Equity Residential REIT, teamed up with competitor AvalonBay Communities to close a $16 billion deal for apartment landlord Archstone in the biggest real estate transaction since the economic downturn. In 2007, he sold Equity Office Properties Trust to Blackstone Group for $39 billion. That same year Zell led an ill-fated $8.2 billion buyout of the Tribune Company, which under his chairmanship filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a year later. The resulting bankruptcy battle ended in December 2012, absolving Zell of fault, but leaving him out more than $300 million.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan added a soccer team to his holdings in 2013, snapping up struggling Premier League club Fulham for $300 million last July. The purchase came a year and a half after the auto parts entrepreneur snagged the NFL's Jaguars for $770 million. In 2013 the Jaguars endured their fifth losing season in the last six years under new head coach Gus Bradley. But Khan's auto parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate powers ahead, with more than $4.4 billion in revenues last year. The Pakistan-born Khan immigrated to the U.S. for college at age 16 and earned an engineering degree from the University of Illinois. Afterward he designed a revolutionary one-piece truck bumper that saved weight while adding structural support.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Leonard Stern owns more than 38 million square feet of property in New Jersey and New York--as well as 120 acres of undeveloped land. In the wake of the real estate and credit collapse, his Hartz Group shed office buildings in favor of apartments, trading in lower-grade office spaces for luxury residential properties across the country. Stern's group owns One Superior Place, a luxury tower in downtown Chicago. He's sitting on industrial spaces that could be turned into luxury lofts, building 582 luxury apartments in New Jersey after opening 280 of them in February. As property values go up with the housing recovery, Stern is getting richer. He's also invested in natural resources via his Hartz Equity portfolio, including fracking in Pennsylvania. Stern joined his family's Hartz Mountain Pet Products in 1959. He began buying land and sold the pet business for $350 million in 2000. Inspired by his late father Max Stern, an immigrant who spent at least half of his time serving his community, Stern is an active philanthropist. He gave $30 million to alma mater NYU in 1988; the business school bears his name. Stern helped publish a book, A Convenient Hatred: The History of Anti-Semitism. He founded Homes for the Homeless and is working on a project to build culinary schools at shelters for homeless women.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>It's been a tough year for Andre Santos Esteves, the chief executive and controlling shareholder of Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual, which has about $50 billion in assets under management. As Brazil's growth outlook worsened in 2013, the country's Ibovespa stock benchmark fell the most among major stock exchanges in the Americas, resulting in a drop of nearly a third in BTG Pactual's stock price. Esteves' offer of a helping hand to former billionaire Eike Batista in March didn't boost his fortune, as his bank reportedly offered a $1 billion credit line to EBX, the parent company of Batista's troubled empire. But Esteves is used to making the most of unstable economic conditions. He started out in the financial world studying mathematics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. While a student he joined the IT department of investment bank Pactual as an intern in 1989, and worked his way up as an ace trader while Brazil was experiencing hyperinflation. He eventually acquired control of the bank and sold it to UBS in 2006, forming the Brazilian subsidiary UBS Pactual. In 2009 he engineered the sale of UBS Pactual to investment firm BTG. In April 2012 Italy's market regulator hit him with a $458,000 fine for alleged insider trading weeks before BTG Pactual's successful IPO. He has said he plans to appeal the decision. Promoting an aggressive and meritocratic management structure, BTG Pactual employs more than 1,500 professionals and has offices in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, United States, United Kingdom and China.</b_desc>

Bernie Ecclestone, a former car salesman and F1 team owner, was involved in 2006 with the sale of a majority stake in the Formula One Group of companies to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. Ecclestone, who still owns 5.3% of the Formula One Group companies directly, along with an 8.5% stake held in his family's Bambino Trust according to Formula Money, is accused of paying German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky $45 million to guarantee his bank, BayernLB, would sell their stake to CVC, and that Bernie would continue to run the show. Ecclestone doesn't deny paying Gribkowsky the money, but he claims the German banker threatened to disclose false information about Bambino Trust, Ecclestone set up for his socialite daughters Tamara and Petra, that would alert British tax authorities. Gribkowsky has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for accepting the bribe, while Ecclestone's trial in Munich is scheduled for April. He is also being sued in London by BayernLB, and by German media group Constantin Media for allegedly orchestrating the the sale at an undervalued price. Ecclestone, who dropped out of school at 16 and, after organizing complex broadcasting deals for Formula One, took over most rights in 1997. The 83-year-old lives in a penthouse above his office; he was forced to step down from the board of Delta Tepco, which manages the Formula One Group of companies, amid the different legal cases against him.</b_desc>

Faria had previously worked as a distributor for Schincariol, a Brazilian brewer that Japan's Kirin Holdings bought in 2012. Petropolis' Itaipava beer is the country's second biggest seller after Skol, made by Anheuser-Busch InBev. Grupo Petropolis 2013 revenues reportedly jumped 50% to $2.9 billion (7 billion reais), partly because production increased after the company opened a new factory in the northeast of Brazil. It also bought the naming rights to a 49,000-seat soccer stadium built to host some of the FIFA World Cup matches. Plus the company is sponsoring the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One Team through its TNT brand of energy drinks. Despite the uptick in revenues, Faria's net worth has dropped about $800 million since last year due to a weaker Brazilian real and lower market values for the beer sector.

      <b_desc>Germany's optician billionaire, Guenther Fielmann is the founder, main shareholder and CEO of Fielmann AG. He opened his first optometry shop in Cuxhaven, Germany in 1972, and took the company public in 1994. Today, his family controls 71.64 % of the shares. The holding is split between Guenther, his son Marc and his daughter Sophie Luise--all of whom hold shares directly--and KORVA SE, a subsidiary of the family foundation. About 80% of Fielmann's 16,000-plus employees retain a holding in the company, either through capital investment or share ownership. They receive salaries, but also interest, a share of profits and dividends. Unencumbered by debt, Fielmann AG has nearly 50% of the market for eyeglass prescriptions in Germany (it also has outlets in Austria and Switzerland). Guenther Fielmann is committed to quality control through training: The nonprofit Fielmann Akademie, in Schleswig Holstein, is Germany's leading optometry school. A committed environmentalist, he grows a tree for every employee each year. He's also an avid bio-farmer, developing ecological agricultural practices and selling organic goods commercially. On one of his farms--Gut Schierensee, owned by the Guenther Fielmann Schierensee Foundation and located about an hour's drive from Hamburg--he breeds rare animals including Limousin cows, Holsteiner horses and Jezersko-Solčava sheep (also known, appropriately enough given Fielmann's profession, as</b_desc>

In October 2013, Gustavo's daughter Adriana became CEO and oversaw the restructuring of the entire group into four main branches: Media, Interactive, Real Estate and Products &amp; Services. Back in 2007, with U.S. billionaire Jerry Perenchio and Mexican billionaire Emilio Azcarraga Jean, Cisneros sold U.S. Spanish-language TV network Univision to a private equity consortium led by U.S. billionaire Haim Saban for $13.7 billion. Although the Cisneros Group's Venevision has tangled with the Venezuelan government in the past, the company now avoids politics, focusing instead on entertainment, including hugely popular Latin American soap operas. Venevision reportedly has a 67% audience share in Venezuela and reaches 500 million people around the world. The Cisneros Group also owns the Miss Venezuela contest, and has reportedly been looking to purchase a television channel in Brazil. In October 2011, Carlos Slim's America Movil bought Cisneros' digital content business, DLA Inc., for $50 million; Cisneros has since been adding digital advertising businesses to his portfolio. He and wife Patricia are familiar figures in high society, hobnobbing with former presidents like George H. W. Bush, designers and fellow billionaires. The couple boasts an extensive collection of Latin American art. Madrid's Reina Sofia Museum displayed some of the collection in 2013.</b_desc>

With a doctorate in rocket science from MIT, in 1974 Sherman took his mother's life savings and bought his uncle's drug company, which became the basis of Apotex. He started with two employees. Today Apotex's 6,500 employees produce some 300 different generic drugs. Apotex does a lot of work in North American courtrooms where the company engages in legal battles in an effort to market cheaper, generic versions of brand-name drugs. Sherman is also involved in some legal troubles of his own. In 2007, his cousins sued him for a partial stake in Apotex, claiming that Sherman's firm is a successor company to the one the billionaire bought from his uncle more than 40 years ago.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Frits Goldschmeding's Randstad Holding has soared nearly 50% in the past year, allowing him to add $1.7 billion to his fortune. The reason? Demand for temporary employees has dramatically increased as the world economy has only slowly rebounded. That's good news for Randstad, the world's second-largest staffing company. He founded the company in 1960 and called it Uitzendbureau Amstelveen. He changed the name four years later to Randstad. Expansion came quickly as it grew into 32 branches in four countries, including Belgium, Germany, and the U.K. by 1970. He took Randstad public in 1990, then merged it with Dutch group Vedior in 2008. Now retired, he still owns 35% of the company. He is also a professor at the Centre for Entrepreneurship of the Nyenrode Business University, and enjoys sailing in his free time.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Steve Wynn has repeatedly made headlines over the past year altering and restating his position on online gambling. Currently, Wynn Resorts does not engage in the practice. He is embroiled in an ongoing legal dispute with Japanese Pachinko tycoon Kazuo Okada, whose nearly 20% stake in Wynn Resorts was forcibly bought out in 2012, citing a report that accused Okada of bribery. Okada maintains the buyback was illegal. Wynn dropped some of the allegations last year; in October a judge placed the case on six month hold while prosecutors further investigate Okada's potential involvement in bribery in the Philippines. Ex-wife Elaine has capitalized on the dispute to try to regain voting control of her Wynn Resorts stock; currently any sales of her shares must be approved by Steve. Wynn remarried in 2011 and maintains several residences, including a 14-room penthouse on Central Park South.</b_desc>

The U.K.'s High Court ruled against McKillen, who claimed the brothers had unlawfully purchased debt and equity sold cheaply after the Celtic Tiger bust. Two years later the Barclays are reportedly seeking to buy McKillen's loans held by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which would seal the battle over the Maybourne group.

      <b_desc>Ralph Dommermuth's fortune has soared by around $1.9 billion over the last year on an 90% rise in the share price of United Internet AG. One of Germany's leading Internet access providers, serving mostly home users and small- to medium-sized enterprises, the company also provides web hosting and storage, email services, marketing solutions for online advertisers and mobile applications. In fiscal year 2012, fueled by strong growth in the access and applications segments, consolidated sales hit a record Eu 2.40 billion ($3.26 billion), up 14.4% over the prior year.

With billionaire Stan Kroenke buying a 60 acre plot of land near Hollywood Park, Roski will now have to fend off possible stadium deals not only from L.A. mogul Phil Anschutz, but also potentially from the St. Louis Rams' owner. Roski oversees Majestic Realty, the commercial and industrial real estate company his father founded in 1948. Majestic Realty owns more than 70 million square feet of real estate, most of which is industrial buildings in Southern California. Properties span from Los Angeles to Atlanta. Majestic is completely family-owned. Roski helped build Staples Center in Los Angeles in 1998 with Anschutz. A University of Southern California alumnus, he and his wife pledged $23 million to his alma mater's fine arts school in 2006 and he currently serves as chairman of the USC board of trustees.

They met when she was hired as a nanny to his two sons, and were married in 1978. Axel, who was 30 years older, apparently groomed her to take on responsibilities at the company. Upon his death in 1985, she assumed control of a juggernaut that currently publishes newspapers in 44 countries, including the leading the German conservative daily, Die Welt, and Germany's largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung. Axel Springer publishes the foreign language editions of Forbes magazine in Poland and Russia. Revenues in 2012 rose 4% to $4.2 billion, of which a healthy 35% was derived from digital media. Since last year, thanks to dividends and a 41% jump in Axel Springer's share price, her fortune has grown by $1.2 billion (she owns 53.35% of the company). Friede Springer is active in various philanthropic organizations and has received numerous awards for her efforts to rebuild German-Jewish relations. She also holds the Federal Cross of Merit for her efforts to promote social, cultural and scientific dialogue worldwide. A member of Germany's conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union, she is a personal friend of chancellor Angela Merkel.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>One of the most admired entrepreneurs in Brazil, Antonio Ermirio de Moraes is the former chairman of family-owned Grupo Votorantim, Latin America's fifth-largest diversified industrial conglomerate. The group does business in more than 20 countries in the aluminum, pulp and paper, energy, and cement industries. It had sales of $10.5 billion in 2012. Almost half of that comes from the cement business, which is taking off as Brazil gets ready for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The group dates back to 1918, when Antonio's father, Jose Ermirio de Moraes, bought a textile factory in Sao Paulo. Today the family still controls 100% of the business. Antonio's fortune is down dramatically from $12.7 billion last year because Forbes uncovered information on the ownership split of the company. Antonio owns 25% and his two siblings and their heirs own the remainder. Six members of the family make the Forbes Billionaires list this year. Antonio left Votorantim's board of directors in 2001 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and he has rarely been seen in public since. Known for having a humble lifestyle, Antonio is also one of Brazil's biggest philanthropists. Longtime friend, economist Jose Pastore, is writing a biography of Antonio.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Lorenzo Mendoza runs Venezuela's largest food company, Empresas Polar. It makes beer and basic food items including flour, condiments, tuna fish and wine. The privately held company reported revenues of $6.5 billion in 2011. A long-time critic of the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, Mendoza continues to struggle with government policies. President Nicolas Maduro has accused him of reducing production and hoarding products to create shortages. Mendoza denies the accusations and in January 2014 announced that the country's currency regulator, CADIVI, owed Polar $463 million, a debt that was keeping the company from importing raw materials needed for production. Polar's company-backed Empresas Polar Foundation is one of Venezuela's biggest charities, with a focus on children's nutrition, health and education.</b_desc>

Though her representatives deny that her holdings have any connection with her father, Forbes research shows that the president has transferred stakes in several companies to his daughter. Holdings in Angola include 25% of Unitel, the largest mobile phone network operator, and a state in Banco BIC. In Portugal she owns 50% of cable TV and Internet firm Zon Optimus and, alongside Portuguese billionaire Americo Amorim, a nearly 7% stake in Portuguese oil and gas firm Galp Energia.</b_desc>

In recent years the company has hustled to evolve in the face of declining demand for fast high-priority shipping. FedEx acquired a stake in African carrier Supaswift in 2013. In November 2013 Smith told reporters he doesn't plan to leave the company he built anytime soon, despite major buy-ins by activist investors like Dan Loeb. Initially hindered by a childhood bone disease, Smith regained his health by age 10, excelled at football, and became a pilot, flying a crop-duster for the Marines during the Vietnam War. During a rough patch in the early days of FedEx, Smith went to Las Vegas to raise the funds to keep his young business afloat, succeeding with $27,000 in gambling winnings.</b_desc>

A political moderate, he struggled to keep Lebanon, deeply divided along sectarian lines, out of the Syrian conflict. In December 2013 a car bomb exploded in front of a Mikati-owned building complex in downtown Beirut, killing a former government minister and bystanders. Before his foray into politics, he and his brother Taha were telecom operators in Africa and Syria through their company Investcom.

Steinmetz acquired the rights from the late dictator Lansana Conté for free, after Conté stripped it from Australian mining giant Rio Tinto. Steinmetz then flipped 51% to Brazilian mining multinational Vale for $2.5 billion, but he's only collected $500 million. Born and raised in Israel, Steinmetz moved to Belgium in 1978 to run his father's diamond business. He eventually became chairman of Geneva-based Steinmetz Diamond Group.</b_desc>

Age 78 at the time of the transaction, he used the remaining assets to build Conglomerado Alfa, a holding company that controls financial firms like Banco Alfa and eleven other companies including Agropalma, Latin America's biggest palm oil producer, hotel chain Transamerica, which operates one of Brazil's most exclusive resorts in Comandatuba Island in the northeast region of the country, La Basque, a premium ice cream maker, C&amp;C, a chain of home improvement stores and others ranging from radio stations to cultural centers. He is reportedly working on a succession plan as none of his five daughters has showed any interest in taking part in the family's business. Today he is mostly retired, spending time on his farm reading and admiring his 150 pure-bred horses.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Haim Saban has gone from success in children's TV to sitting at the helm of the largest U.S. Spanish-language TV broadcaster, Univision. Saban's first hit was children's TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the early 1990s. In 2007, Saban and a group of private equity investors bought broadcaster Univision for $13.7 billion; he is company's chairman and has a stake worth about $600 million. Univision is the fifth largest TV network in the U.S. In early 2013, Saban Capital purchased a controlling stake in publicly traded Israeli telecom firm Partner Communications. Saban Brands owns and manages the Power Rangers brand and the Paul Frank brand, known for its monkey, Julius. Saban sold Fox Family Channel, a joint venture with News Corp., to Disney in 2001 for $5 billion; Saban's take was $1.7 billion. Saban and his wife, Cheryl, have donated nearly $47 million to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, $11 million to the Saban Free Clinic (formerly the Los Angeles Free Clinic) and just over $15 million to the Soroka Medical Center in Israel.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>The stereotype of financially conservative Germans having an aversion to leverage doesn't apply to Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler and her only son, Georg, proprietors of INA Waelzlager Schaeffler KG, one of world's largest producers of roller bearings and machine components. In 2008, the company announced a $15-billion, debt-financed takeover of publicly traded tire and auto parts giant Continental AG. For a while, in the wake of the ensuing worldwide financial crisis, it looked as if the high-wire act might all come crashing down. Continental's sales and share price plummeted, forcing the Schaefflers into debt-restructuring negotiations with their creditor banks. When the dust settled, after a Continental rights offering to raise capital and a round of debt refinancing, Schaeffler Group owned 49.9% of Continental. Since then, as the auto market has rebounded, the Schaefflers have continued to pay down debt via Continental share sales and excess cash flow. Since bottoming out in February 2009, Continental's share price has risen by more than 14-fold. Schaeffler Group now owns 36% of the company, a stake worth around $16 billion. In January 2013, a prestigious jury -- comprised of representatives from the German business world and the business newspaper Handelsblatt -- named Maria-Elisabeth Family Business Woman of the Year 2012. She took over INA in 1996 following the death of her husband, Georg.</b_desc>

He also donated $102 million to his alma mater Penn State to build a hockey arena, which opened this fall, and field a division one team. Now, he's putting $170 million into building a development complex in downtown Buffalo that will feature two ice rinks, a hotel and a restaurant. A former Penn State math major, Pegula switched to petroleum engineering for a scholarship and joined Getty Oil after graduation.

Better times are ahead, he says. At least plans are moving forward for a new Oilers stadium development that will cost an estimated $600 million, funded jointly by taxpayers, the city and the team. Katz will own surrounding properties and land around the new stadium. That deal has boosted Forbes' valuation of the NHL team to $400 million, up 78% from the previous year. The son of a pharmacist, Katz bought up distressed drug stores in the late 1990s, amassing an empire of 1,800 stores across Canada. In 2012 the Katz Group shed a large number of stores by selling its Medicine Shoppe pharmacy business and its Drug Trading unit to McKesson Corp. for $1 billion.

      <b_desc>Peter Kellogg took the lead at his father's brokerage firm, Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, in 1973. It was the first specialist brokerage to control more than 10% of the stocks trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2000 Kellogg sold the firm to Goldman Sachs for $6.5 billion. Kellogg and his reinsurance company, IAT, filed suit against the Internal Revenue Service in April for a refund of $186 million in taxes and interest paid after the agency revoked the company's tax-exemption retroactively. He has donated upwards of $4 million to U.S. ski and snowboarding teams and $20 million to the Berkshire School, a prep school Kellogg attended in Sheffield, Mass.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>In August 2009, Facebook turned down Brian Acton, an experience engineer who had previously worked at Yahoo and Apple, for a position. More than four years later, they're paying him $3 billion to acquire the startup he cofounded after his rejection from the social network. In Feb. 2014, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based tech giant announced it was buying mobile messaging application, WhatsApp, for $19 billion in cash and stock. That deal immediately made the 42-year-old Acton a member of the 10-figure fortune club. CEO Jan Koum and Acton created WhatsApp in 2009 as the first smartphone app to let people send text messages between different phones and countries for free, using only their cell phone numbers. It is now the biggest mobile messaging service in the world with 430 million active users, bigger than Skype and Snapchat combined. With the vast majority of users outside the U.S., WhatsApp is on nearly every smartphone in Spain and Hong Kong, and used by half the population of Holland. It's aiming to reach 1 billion registered users by the end of 2014.</b_desc>

The company also operates gaming venues, recently entering into a joint venture with Churchill Downs on plans to build a casino in Ohio. With the NHL lockout in the rear view mirror, Delaware North is on track for record revenues in 2013. Jacobs' father founded the business in 1915 by selling popcorn and peanuts. Jacobs took over as CEO after his father's death in 1968. He now runs the $2.6 billion (sales) business with his three sons. One of Boston's richest people, he led a fundraising effort by area sports franchises following the Boston Marathon bombings, which helped pull in more than $1 million.

Though his company, Grupo Televisa, is likely to face a new challenge on its main turf, television services, it might end up gaining more in other areas. Over the past few years, Televisa has been making inroads into telephone and internet services. It also owns a 50% stake in Mexico's third-largest mobile telephone company, Grupo Iusacell. The Mexican phone business is worth an estimated $80 billion, 10 times larger than Mexico's TV industry, with an estimated value of $8 billion. Azcárraga and Televisa might also benefit from a recent FCC proposal to soften the decades-old 25% limit on foreign ownership of TV and radio stations. Televisa is looking to control U.S. Spanish television network Univision. Azcárraga became the CEO of Grupo Televisa after the death of his father in 1997.</b_desc>

Shares in Wang's Hong Kong-listed flagship Golden Eagle Retail Group lost about a fifth of their value in the past year. Operating profit at the Nanjing-based company fell by nearly 5 percent in the first half of the year to $126 million amid a decline in Golden Eagle's margins on concessionaire and direct sales. Wang was born in the mainland, raised in Taiwan, studied in the U.S. and found early business success in California before setting up Golden Eagle in eastern China.

      <b_desc>Nuclear physicist Peter Buck was the brains and the bankroll behind Subway. He suggested that his friend's son, Fred Deluca, open a local sub shop and loaned him $1,000. The business has since grown into Subway and Buck still owns half, though his role in the company has diminished over the years. DeLuca owns the other half and remains CEO. With more than 40,000 locations from Afghanistan to Zambia, Subway overtook McDonalds in the spring of 2011 to become the largest restaurant chain in the world. The company doesn't own a single location, but collects 8% of revenue from each franchisee. In 2004 Buck donated a 23.1-carat ruby to the Smithsonian, naming the stone for his late wife, Carmen Lucia.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Fred DeLuca took a rural Connecticut sub shop and grew it in the world's largest restaurant chain: Subway. In 1965, DeLuca, then a 17-year-old high schooler, started the company as Pete's Super Submarines, named after Peter Buck, a family friend and a nuclear physicist, who suggested the idea to DeLuca. (Subway's official name remains Doctor's Associates.) Soon DeLuca set the goal of 32 stores within 10 years. By 1974, he had just 16 shops, and it was clear he wasn't on track to make it. As a result, he switched to a franchise model. Today Subway has more than 37,000 restaurants across the world. DeLuca's favorite Subway sandwiches are the Veggie Delight and Turkey.</b_desc>

He went to Dartmouth College and the University of Chicago graduate school before beginning a near-decade-long stint with The First National Bank of Chicago. He cofounded Carlyle in 1987. The company enjoyed early success by using its politically connected advisers, including former president George H.W.

In the last few months the company has aggressively expanded overseas, made its first-ever acquisition (of a digital fitness company) and signed a 10-year deal to become the official apparel supplier to the University of Notre Dame, the largest deal in NCAA history valued at a reported $90 million. Under Armour also has deals with 12 other universities, including Auburn, South Carolina and Maryland. The youngest of five boys, Plank was a walk-on special teams player with U. of Maryland football when he noticed sweat-soaked T-shirts weighing down players so he created a skintight, sweat-wicking synthetic shirt. In its first year, his company racked up $17,000 in sales. Expected revenue in 2013: more than $2.25 billion. Plank has said publicly that his goal is to double that number by 2016. Nearly all his wealth is tied up in Under Armour stock, which is up three-fourths in the past year. He also owns 530-acre Sagamore Farm in Maryland.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Grocery investor Ron Burkle, head of private equity firm Yucaipa Companies, may be engaged in a losing battle over Morgans Hotel Group. Despite submitting a formal bid to take the company private, the hotel group borrowed against its properties to pay off the majority of a reported $220 million in debt held by Yucaipa. That's after Yucaipa and Burkle, who sits on the board, filed a suit in June 2013 to keep their board seats, which they were asked to vacate by shareholders. A diverse investor, Burkle primarily backs private companies that support the food trade in areas like logistics, cold storage and food safety. He's also put money into technology ventures including Airbnb and Foursquare, as well as entertainment firm Relativity Media. Forbes' estimate of his net worth has fallen since last year in part due to a bankruptcy filing by car hauling firm Allied Systems Holdings. In addition, Yucaipa currently manages more than $10 billion, but reportedly cut management fees recently because of poor returns. The son of a grocer, Burkle started working as a box boy at age 13. In 1986, he formed investment firm Yucaipa, and bought and sold supermarket chains Fred Meyer, Jurgensen's, Ralphs and others. He paid a reported $1.5 million for one of the four gold medals won by sprinter Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics.</b_desc>

Good skills for a tough salt with something to prove: Back in his native Norway, he set about building a shipping fleet, becoming a ruthless corporate raider. Rokke sold off his yacht in 2003 after his empire nearly went under. But he's back on top now as the majority owner of shipping and offshore drilling conglomerate Aker ASA. Rokke married a second time in 2004 to Anne Grete Eidsvig, and made her a business partner. Rokke owns Norwegian soccer club Molde FK, which plays in Aker Stadium, a gift Rokke made in the 1990s.

In 2013 the partners, together with Arkady Rotenberg, a billionaire who practices judo with Vladimir Putin, won a tender to develop part of Sheremetyevo, the state-owned airport outside Moscow. The project includes a new terminal for 15 million passengers, a building that will hold 500,000 tons of cargo, a refueling complex and a tunnel connecting the airport's southern and northern complexes. The partners have already invested $1 billion in the project. A unit of the partners' TPS Real Estate Holdings Ltd. is the main contender to buy the government's 83% stake in the airport in a privatization plan slated for 2016. In the summer of 2012 Skorobogatko and Ponomarenko joined with Rotenberg to found TPS. The company bought more than half of the space in Ocean Plaza, the biggest shopping center in Kiev, for $280 million.

Anisimov pins his hopes on construction project of a grand park Rossiya in Moscow Oblast', intended for 10m visitors per year. Anisimov hopes that the park will at least partly be constructed on the land he owns. Anisimov has darted in and out of the spotlight since the 1990s, when he owned banks and aluminum plants. He liquidated everything in 2000, and kept a very low profile. Four years later, he emerged from the shadows as an investor in Metalloinvest, along with rising fellow billionaires Alisher Usmanov and Andrei Skoch.</b_desc>

Analysts also questioned SunTV's purchase of a new corporate jet. Maran sold a small chunk of his stake in the broadcaster to comply with public holding rules but upped his holding in his loss-making budget airline SpiceJet to 50%, even as shares dipped. The airline, which is rumored to be mulling a stake sale, is bracing for imminent competition from soon to-be-launched AirAsia India. It recently signed an interline pact with Singapore's Tiger Airways and is reportedly mulling buying 40 Boeing planes for $4 billion. Maran has partnered Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan in Sun DTH, a direct-to-home television services venture.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Robert Pera is once again a billionaire, after missing the cut in 2013, thanks to stellar performance of his Ubiquiti Networks, which nearly tripled in value in the past year. It was enough for him to make Forbes list of 400 Richest Americans in Fall 2013. He first became a billionaire after Ubiquiti, a software and systems communications technology company focused on emerging markets, went public in October 2011. The stock tanked in 2012 amid Wall Street skepticism and a problem with Chinese criminals counterfeiting the company's products. A Shenzhen court recently sentenced one of the operation's ring leaders to five years in prison. Pera started out as a hardware engineer with Apple in 2003, but after just two years he left the company to start Ubiquiti. By keeping costs low, Ubiquiti can afford to outcompete established competitors like Motorola on price while maintaining robust profit margins. Ubiquiti's product range includes Wi-Fi amplification systems that can provide internet access to as few as 10 people or more than 10,000 customers within a 36-mile radius. Pera purchased a significant stake in the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies in 2012 and is the chairman and principal owner. He graduated from the University of California at San Diego and holds a masters in electrical engineering.</b_desc>

As part of the deal, the Buenos retained 10% of Amil, which has since delisted its stock. Edson bought $470 million worth of UnitedHealth shares (now worth $580 million) and joined the U.S. insurer's board -- even though he did not speak English fluently. The Buenos founded Amil in 1972. Edson, the son of a truck driver, decided to become a doctor at age 14 while working at a struggling clinic, which he bought before getting a medical degree from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. The Buenos also own shares in Dasa, a publicly-traded chain of laboratories, and in Totalcare, which invests in hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.

The story of the Niarchos clan is fraught with drama worthy of a Hollywood film: from love triangles and private islands to drug overdoses and accusations of murder. Philip was the oldest of Stavros? four children with Eugenia Livianos, and he inherited the bulk of his father's art collection. Bought in 1957 for $3 million from actor Edward Robinson, who needed to pay for his divorce, the Niarchos family collection includes some of the world's most recognizable pieces by some of the most important names out there. It is said to be the largest private collection of Van Goghs, including a self portrait of the Dutch master after having chopped off his own ear; they also own one of the most iconic works by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, ?Yo Picasso.? While it is difficult to quantify how much such pieces would fetch at auction, the collection has grown under Philip, who added a lot of post-war and contemporary works including pieces by Andy Warhol and Maurizio Cattelan. Philip is credited by some as having put Haitian-American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in the category of absolute masters after buying a self-portrait for a then-record $3.3 million in 1982. Today, Basquiat's work sets global records, including the $48.8 million ?Dustheads? sold at Christie's in 2013.</b_desc>

Though he built Hubert Burda Media via mass-market print publications -- the German newsweekly Focus and the celebrity magazine Bunte are company mainstays -- digital sources now account for fully half of revenue. A big success in the digital realm is BurdaStyle.com -- the largest online DIY fashion and sewing community, with more than 800,000 registered active members and nearly seven million monthly page views. In April 2013, Hubert Burda Media and F+W Media Inc., which caters to craft and hobby communities, entered into a multi-faceted licensing deal for marketing the Burda Style brand and BurdaStyle.com in the U.S. and Canada. Other companies in the Burda digital portfolio include Holidaycheck, Elitepartners, Zooplus and Xing -- the German equivalent of the U.S. professional networking website LinkedIn. In 2010, Hubert Burda handed over day-to-day control of his company to Paul-Bernhard Kallen, a former McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant and chief financial officer, and subsequently transferred a 40% ownership stake to his two children, Jacob and Elisabeth, who are in their twenties. (He still owns the remaining 60%). Among his philanthropic endeavors is the Felix Burda Foundation, which is committed to reducing the number of deaths from colon cancer in Germany (it's named after his son Felix, who died of colon cancer in 2001, at age 33). He also supports The Bambi, aka the Bambi Awards, which recognize excellence in international media and television; the Hermann-Lenz-Prize, a German literary award; the Burda Center for Innovative Communication, a media center at Ben Gurion University in Israel; and the Burda Academy of the Third Millennium, an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and thinkers.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>NorgesGruppen is a storied food retailer and wholesaler in Norway, with a 40% market share. You wouldn't know it from Johan Johannson. The heir to a company founded in 1866, Johannson is exceedingly media-shy, and leads a quiet and reportedly frugal life with his three young children. NorgesGruppen operates more than 1,750 grocery stores and a chain of 500 convenience chains. That makes it easy for Norwegians to pick up Fiskemannen (it's private-label fish and shellfish), Ferskt og ferdig (ready-to-eat meals) and Go Eco, it's green and organic products.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Last year, at the age of 90, David Murdock took his Dole Foods private in a deal that valued the company at $1.6 billion. It's been a long relationship with the world's largest producer of fruits and vegetables. In 1985, Murdock bought the failing Hawaiian real estate outfit that owned Dole and 98% of the Hawaiian island Lanai. He took Dole public in 2009, the same year he got an honorary high school diploma. Murdock sold his portion of Lanai to Larry Ellison for a reported $300 million and likely used the cash to finance the Dole buy-out. Murdock dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and worked at a gas station before being drafted into the Army in 1943.</b_desc>

Hong Kong-listed flagship Zijin Mining Group's firsthalf net profit fell 54% to $180 million, pulling down the company's share price by a third. Chen has looked for value with new investments in Australia, including Norton Gold Fields, a Zijin controlled subsidiary listed on Australian Securities Exchange that acquired Kalgoorlie Mining last year. Zijin also set up a joint venture with Toronto-listed Sprott and Americas Now Resources Investment Management in March to invest in commodities, contributing $100 million to a fund with a targeted size of $500 million. Chen's southeastern Chinese regional department store chain New Huadu Supercenter also had a rough first half as profits fell 81%.

Murray Edwards derives most of his fortune from stakes in Canadian oil and mining companies but his net worth climbed $250 million from a year ago in part because of a jump in the value of his estimated 30% stake in the Calgary Flames hockey team. Forbes valued the team at $420 million in 2013, up 70% from the prior year. Edwards is a central figure in the NHL and was heavily involved in the negotiations between owners and players during the 2012 lockout. That negotiating prowess had defined Murray's career, one in which he has slowly built up positions at companies like oil sands miner Canada Natural Resources, where he is chairman. A former partner at Calgary-based law firm Burnet, Duckworth and Palmer, he also serves as chairman at Ensign Energy Services and Magellan Aerospace Corporation and owns ski resorts through a company called Resorts of the Canadian Rockies.</b_desc>

When the tech bubble burst, much of Wadhwani's fortune evaporated as i2 shares collapsed. He then invested $250 million to start, acquire or build a dozen business software and IT companies, now called Symphony Technologies Group, which he chairs. That put him back on the billionaires list in 2010. Symphony's companies have a combined $2 billion in revenue and more than 14,000 employees.

Sales dropped 9% in 2012 to $1.1 billion (808 million euros) and 11% through the first three quarters of 2013. Now Geox is shifting strategies and looking to emerging markets like Russia and India. The company tried to enter the Indian market in 2006 but failed and pulled out. Moretti Polegato is trying again, with plans to build 25 stores in India over the next three years.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>The icon of American womenswear finally hit the $1 billion mark in February, having flirted with billionaire status ever since his eponymous company went public in December 2011. Long Island native Kors dropped out of the Fashion Institute of Technology in his first year, but was soon discovered by a Bergdorf Goodman buyer; he launched his line in 1981 at New York's top department stores. He overcame a bankruptcy in 1993, then proved himself once more by turning around the fortunes of French fashion house Celine as head womenswear designer. Kors became a household name outside fashion circles in the U.S. in 2004, when he took the stage as a judge on reality TV hit Project Runway. He earned a legion of new fans with his amusingly barbed comments when confronted with a less-than-chic design created by one of the show's young hopefuls. Kors joins Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll on the Billionaires' list; the investing duo bought a controlling stake in Michael Kors LLC in 2003. It was worth $100 million then. Today, its market cap hovers around $20 billion. How's that for a fashionable return on investment?</b_desc>

In an audiotape leaked to website TMZ in late April, Sterling told his girlfriend, V. Stiviano, not to bring black people to Clippers games. On April 29, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the NBA for life and fined him $2.5 million. The NBA Board of Governors may well decide to force Sterling to sell the team, which Forbes now values at $575 million. Sterling paid $12.5 million for the team in 1981. He amassed his fortune over several decades, buying mostly down-at-the-heels apartment buildings primarily in Los Angeles; he also owns properties in Orange County, San Diego and Las Vegas and advertises heavily in the L.A.

As of mid-Feb. 2014, the $36 billion (2013 fiscal year sales) company had its share price rise more than 60% over the previous 12 months. Couche-Tard has been working to integrate its $2.6 billion acquisition of oil giant Statoil ASA's retail business, which operates mainly in Norway. With ownership over retail brands such as Circle K, Mac's Convenience stores and Statoil Fuel &amp; Retail, Couche-Tard oversees more than 8,300 stores worldwide, of which about 6,200 are company-operated. Bouchard, 64, has been rejiggering convenience stores since he stocked his first shelf at 19 at his brother's franchised Perrette store in Bois-des-Filion, Quebec. He spent five years laying out new stores as the chain expanded. Then he tried his hand as a franchisee for another Quebec operator, Provi-Soir, but chafed at the corporate mandates.

Along the way he invested in tech companies, a cookie bakery and a pioneering robotic surgery company. Duggan's 2004 bet on Pharmacyclics -- which he told Forbes enticed him because of its drug that treated brain tumors similar to those that afflicted his son -- appeared destined for disaster, especially after regulators rejected the treatment in 2007. He then took over the position of CEO from founder Dr. Richard Miller. That drug ultimately failed, but a second medicine, Imbruvica, bought on the cheap by his predecessor, is now on the market and being sold with partner Johnson &amp; Johnson. The stock has been soaring, under Duggan's leadership, amid a larger biotech boom. He is a top donor to the Church of Scientology, of which he is a member.</b_desc>

He also has plans to launch his first retail store in Delhi in 2014. Modi, who grew up in Belgium, dropped out of Wharton and moved to India in 1990 to work with his jeweler uncle who taught him the trade. In 1999 he left to set up Firestar International, which today has revenues of $1.6 billion and manufacturing units in India, Russia, Armenia and South Africa. Modi, who aspires to be the Cartier of India, got noticed when his Lotus necklace with a rare Golconda diamond was auctioned by Christie's for $3 million in 2008.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>With the coal industry in upheaval, West Virginia billionaire Jim Justice has seen a small dip in his net worth. He made a timely sale of a sizable portion of his coal operation to Russian mining and steel company Mechel OAO for $436 million in cash and approximately $240 million worth of Mechel preferred shares in 2009 before the industry began to tank. But those shares dropped more than 75% in the past year, and Justice's remaining coal operations have struggled: idled plants, layoffs and lawsuits from nearly a dozen companies claiming Justice's businesses haven't been paying their bills. But with cash from the sale to Mechel, the West Virginia native switched his focus from coal to tourism just at the right time, plugging $400 million into buying up and renovating hotels and resorts. That includes the iconic the Greenbrier Resort, which was hemorrhaging money before Justice gave it a makeover and began hosting events including the PGA Tour, poker and blackjack tournaments and a tennis match between legends John McEnroe and Pete Sampras. He's also building a state-of-the-art medical research and education facility on the hotel grounds for a reported $250 million. He recently announced he was testing the market to sell his Wintergreen Resort, a separate 11,000-acre estate. Justice received his bachelor's and M.B.A from Marshall University before joining his father's coal mining firm Bluestone Industries in 1976. He started Bluestone Farms the next year as a subsidiary of the family business; it eventually became the largest grain producer on the east coast.</b_desc>

Einhorn secured an early victory last year, dropping a lawsuit against Apple after helping to push CEO Tim Cook to return more capital to shareholders.The poker aficionado, who competed in a charity event at the World Series of Poker in June, saw his short bets suffer. Betting against the company for more than two years, Einhorn got roasted by Green Mountain Coffee as its shares continue to rise; GMCR just signed a deal that will see Coca-Cola take a 10% stake in the company. Greenlight Capital saw its returns hurt by Chipotle, another of Einhorn's short bets that hasn't come to fruition, as the stock continues to make new highs. Gold also hurt Einhorn in 2013, as Greenlight still holds on to its stake in gold miners. The hedge fund manager is currently engaged in a legal battle with a financial blogging website after a contributor leaked information regarding a long position in Micron. Einhorn sits on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.

A shuffle of his two-thirds stake in Seven Group--the ultimate holder of Caterpillar licenses and TV, newspaper and magazine interests--could mean the start of a succession; 2 sons, Ryan and Bryant, hold executive positions in the group. Said he would retire after the Sydney Olympics in 2000, when he turned 60. Stokes started with a franchise to sell Cat tractors and trucks in Australia and then expanded into China where demand is surging. Once regarded as a minor player in newspapers and television, his Seven Group has a bigger market share in Australia than the country's better-known media baron, fellow billionaire and U.S. citizen Rupert Murdoch.

      <b_desc>Sergio Lins Andrade, new to the Forbes Billionaires list, is chairman of the board of Andrade Gutierrez, a privately held Brazil-based multinational conglomerate active primarily in construction. Revenues in 2012 were $8 billion (R$16.8 billion).

The company is now owned by various members of the Andrade and Gutierrez families. Sergio's stake is just over 33%. Privatization of infrastructure sectors in Brazil in the 1990s enabled the company to expand into public infrastructure concessions and telecommunications. In October 2013 Sergio Andrade made headlines in Brazil after being accused of sanitary sewer violation at his multimillion-dollar mansion in a gated community in Rio de Janeiro. Through his lawyers, he denied any wrongdoing. He enjoys piloting gliders and scuba diving. An art history enthusiast, he is married to Brazilian painter and sculptor Adriana Barreto.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>After many decades as one of Argentina's most important businessmen, Gregorio Perez Companc retired from the active management of his companies in 2009. Perez Companc's biggest move was to sell his energy company, Pecom, to Brazil's Petrobras for approximately $1.2 billion in 2001 after losing to Spain's Repsol in an attempt to merge with state-owned YPF. Perez Companc, an avid car collector, started out working in the family banking group, Banco Rio, only to buyout his family in the early 1990s. By 1997, he sold it to Spanish banking giant Santander. During the 1990s, a wave of privatizations allowed Perez Companc to claim stakes in all sorts of businesses, from telecommunications and public utilities to railroads and shopping malls. In 1990 he invested $400 million for a 60% stake in Molinos Rio de La Plata, a diversified maker of pasta, flour, and frozen vegetables, which he has built into one of the major food producers and exporters of Argentina; in 2009, he transferred his 75% stake to his 7 living children. Perez Companc also owns Goyaike, which holds more than 740,000 acres throughout Argentina used for wool production, crops, biotechnology, cattle, and milk production. At the urging of his wife, Perez Companc founded Munchi's, a major ice cream chain in Argentina; he also built Bioparque Temaiken, a nature and wildlife preserve outside of Buenos Aires. Intensely Catholic, Perez Companc also loves cars, having a notable collection of Ferraris including a 1962 Testa Rossa, a 2004 Formula One model used by Michael Schumacher, an Enzo, and a limited edition F50.</b_desc>

He is the co-founder, with his twin brother Pedro Grendene Bartelle, of Grendene, the world's largest sandal manufacturer and Brazil's leading shoe exporting company.

Grendene makes some 185 million pairs of shoes annually and exports about 24% of its production to more than 90 countries. It produces supermodel Gisele Bundchen's line of Ipanema GB jelly sandals, which compete with the well-known Havaianas brand and account for more than 60% of the company's annual exports. Alexandre is also involved in other businesses in Brazil and abroad, including Dell'Anno, a modular wood kitchen and closet manufacturing listed company, and Agropecuaria Jacarezinho, a farmland holding company.

They have plenty of cash to spend: the brothers sold their nearly 70% combined interested in hydraulic fracturing and oil field services outfit Frac Tech to a partnership led by Singapore's Temasek Holdings for $3.5 billion in May 2011. But before fracking there were bricks. Father Voy Wilks took up bricklaying so he could move his family out of a goat shed and into a proper house. He then asked his employer at a Cisco, Texas, factory for a small raise. When his employer refused, Voy quit and switched his career to masonry. Following in their father's footsteps the brothers became masons themselves, founding Wilks Masonry together in 1995. Seven years later, the brothers founded Frac Tech.

She and her twin sister Lina (also a billionaire) were adopted by Aguiar after being abandoned in front of a Bradesco branch in Sao Paulo. Aguiar died in 1991, and the sisters have been fighting since then in Brazilian courts over the late banker's will, which was annulled in favor of Aguiar's second wife, whom he married less than five months before his death and was 40 years his junior. The soap-opera-like case is still ongoing and the sisters have mostly prevailed in court. In September 2013 they lost a legal battle that could have earned them another 4% of Bradesco's shares held through Bradesco Foundation, the bank's pioneering social investment vehicle, for which Aguiar left most of his fortune. They can still appeal the ruling. The sisters also have shares of Bradespar, Bradesco's non-financial arm, which holds a key stake in Vale SA, the world's largest iron-ore exporter. In 2008 Lia started her own foundation, the Lia Maria Aguiar Foundation, to benefit the city of Campos de Jordao, where she has been living since the early 1990s.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Few have done more to usher in the Greek yogurt craze in the United States than Hamdi Ulukaya -- the founder, president and CEO of Chobani. Born in Turkey, he came to the United States to study business in 1997 and in 2001 he started a feta cheese company in central New York. But Ulukaya's billion-dollar dairy idea wasn't cheese. In 2005 he bought a Kraft Foods yogurt plant in a neighboring town and began perfecting the recipe for Greek-style yogurt. The first order was shipped in October 2007, and now revenues exceed $1.2 billion. Ulukaya has continued to reinvest in growing the company, purchasing a factory in Twin Falls, Idaho, in December 2012. Ernst &amp; Young named him their 2013 entrepreneur of the year. But he's faced some adversity of late: Russia blocked shipments of the company's yogurt bound for U.S. Olympic athletes in Sochi, which Chobani ultimately donated to food banks in New York and New Jersey. The company issued a recall in September after consumers complained of mold-tainted yogurt cups. Additionally, Whole Foods has decided to no longer carry Chobani products. Ex-wife Alyse Giray is suing Ulukaya for $1.5 billion, claiming she gave him money to start and expand his original business in exchange for a 53% stake. Ulukaya has said the suit has no merit.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>The American coal industry is in the doldrums, but there's one bright spot: Chris Cline and his Foresight Energy. As other coal miners go under, Foresight is rolling, with $130 million in 2012 net income on sales of 15 million tons of coal from brand-new mines boasting the lowest costs in the industry. He had planned to do an IPO of Foresight, but after a $1.5 billion debt refinancing in August 2013 he may not bother. He owns 60% of the company. In the 1990s, Cline -- the son of a coal miner and a former miner himself-- had the foresight to buy up coal reserves in the Illinois Basin, acquiring mines from the likes of U.S. Steel and Exxon. No one had wanted the coal after 1992 amendments to the Clean Air Act because it was high in sulfur content, and created lots of sulfur dioxide when burned for electricity. But Cline believed that innovations and pollution control technology would allow coal to make a comeback. Because the high-sulfur coal had been ignored for so long, the coal seams are thicker, not as deep underground, and thus easier (and cheaper) to mine. As a result his costs, at roughly $22 per ton, are significantly lower than the $50 per ton incurred at the average mine east of the Mississippi. For his next big venture, Cline has assembled vast reserves of iron ore in Michigan and hopes to open a mine there if he can get around unhappy environmentalists and native tribes. If that doesn't work out, Cline still has some other things going for him: a big yacht named Mine Games, a mansion in West Palm Beach, and (since late 2012) a budding romance with his neighbor Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of Tiger Woods.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Farkhad Akhmedov got his start in business in the late 1980s selling Russian sables at the London commodity exchange. In 1987 he founded Tansley Trading, which supplied equipment for Russian gas producers. In 1993 he became a minority shareholder in Nortgas, an oil and gas company in Siberia. Russian natural gas giant Gazprom had a controlling stake in Nortgas but Akhmedov steadily bought up shares and by the late ?90s he managed to dilute Gazprom's stake to 0.5%, while proclaiming that Gazprom did not invest a dime in Nortgas. But to wage a war with Gazprom is to pay dearly. Gazprom took legal action and in 2005 the parties came to a settlement. Akhmedov wound up returning a 51% stake in Nortgas to Gazprom for free. In 2012 Gazprom competitor Novatek, owned by billionaires Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko, bought Akhmedov's stake in Nortgas. Akhmedov has invested $55 million in a pomegranate juice factory in his native Azerbaijan, where his father worked during the Soviet era.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Jeff Rothschild joins the list this year as the least well known of Facebook's growing clan of billionaires. As vice president of infrastructure software, he started at Facebook in 2005 after being brought on as a consultant by investor Accel Partners. By far the oldest person at the company when he started, he's managed to last nine years at the Menlo Park, Calif.-based social networking company. He works there part-time now. When Facebook went public, his 1.2% stake was larger than Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's. Rothschild has benefitted from the company's skyrocketing share price. The stock is up more than 135% over the past 12 months. A seasoned entrepreneur, he cofounded Veritas Software in 1988 and gaming company Mpath Interactive in 1995. He still works as an advisor at Accel Partners.</b_desc>

During the 1980s, Cardiolab was rebranded as Labs D'Or and expanded into a network of health diagnosis centers throughout Rio de Janeiro. In 1998 Moll opened his first hospital D'Or, located in Barra da Tijuca, a popular borough in Rio. Today Rede D'Or operates 24 hospitals in several Brazilian cities with more than 4,000 beds, and is building another four. In 2012 revenues were $1.3 billion (R$3.122 billion). In 2010, Moll sold Labs D'or to publicly-traded Fleury SA, a Brazilian medical services provider, for $414 million (R$1 billion). That same year he acquired control of Sao Luiz, a Sao Paulo-based hospital group. The deal was financed by fellow billionaire Andre Esteves' BTG Pactual bank through convertible debentures issued by Rede D'Or Sao Luiz SA. Moll makes the billionaires' list this year thanks to his 78% stake in the private company. Last year he gave up his post as CEO of Rede D'Or to become Chairman of the Board, as part of the company's expansion plans. He is married and has nine children, most of whom work at the company's hospitals.</b_desc>

A serial entrepreneur, Oringer had come up with one of the world's first pop-up blockers as a computer science graduate student at Columbia U. He noticed email blasts of new products got more clicks when they included pictures, but stock photos from companies like Getty were too expensive. So he bought a camera, took 30,000 pictures and started a website that sold pictures for cheap. When users started downloading his photos faster than he could upload them, he hired contributors to take more pictures. The site now has over 30 million photos, 40,000 contributors and 2012 revenues of $170 million. Oringer sold 7% of the company in September 2013 for $145 million pre-tax. The company's stock is up 350% since going public, and Oringer's remaining 46% stake was recently worth more than $1.2 billion.

      <b_desc>Jose Roberto Ermirio de Moraes is new to the Forbes Billionaires list this year. He is a grandson of Jose Ermirio de Moraes, who founded family-owned Grupo Votorantim, Latin America's fifth-largest diversified industrial conglomerate. The group does business in more than 20 countries in the aluminum, pulp and paper, energy, and cement industries. It had sales of $10.5 billion in 2012. Almost half of that comes from the cement business, which is taking off as Brazil gets ready for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The group dates back to 1918, when Jose Ermirio de Moraes bought a textile factory in Sao Paulo. Today the family still controls 100% of the business. Jose Roberto inherited an 8% stake in Votorantim after the death of his father, Jose Ermirio de Moraes Filho.</b_desc>

Groupon spent $260 million to buy South Korean online retailer Ticket Monster from LivingSocial, and Lefkofsky said the acquisition will serve as the backbone of Groupon's business in Asia. Lefkofsky was already a successful entrepreneur with a two businesses when Andrew Mason, who freelanced for him as a coder, called with the idea for Groupon. Lefkofsky offered him $1 million to drop out of school and get started. Groupon's largest individual shareholder, Lefkofsky took over as CEO in August, six months after Mason was fired from the post.

He died in a fire in his Monaco penthouse in 1999, leaving most of his fortune to the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation. The assets he left to Lily turned her into a billionaire. She chairs the foundation, which supports education, science and medicine, religion, culture and humanitarian relief in 40 countries; it has reportedly donated over $250 million since its creation 15 years ago. Lily Safra also donates to charity through the Lily Safra Hope Foundation. She previously owned a stake in Brazilian retailer Ponto Frio, but sold her interest in 2009 to Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD) for about $340 million. She is seeking an additional payment of $83 million from CBD, claiming to have suffered financial damage from the way the payments for the deal were set up. A spokesperson for Safra declined to comment on the matter, citing confidentiality issues; the dispute is still being arbitrated by the International Chamber of Commerce. In August 2013, Safra made headlines after her nephew blocked her unauthorized biography in Brazil.</b_desc>

Their father Angelo founded the company in 1962, and the brothers took it public in 2006. Saras refines 300,000 barrels of oil a day. Just one of its refineries accounts for 15% of Italy's refining capacity. In the last decade Gian Marco, who is chairman, and Massimo, the CEO, have moved into alternative fuels. Through Saras, they own the largest liquid fuel gasification plant in the world, which takes heavy residue and turns it into usable gasoline. Saras also has a wind farm on Sardinia, the Mediterranean island between Spain and Italy. But most of the company's business is in oil. Saras sold 2.2 million tons of it in Italy alone in 2012. The company is expanding in Spain and has 114 gas stations, primarily along the Mediterranean coast in southern Spain. Most of Gian Marco's fortune is outside of Saras; he sold more than $850 million (684 million Euros) in stock at the public offering in 2006. Each brother still has a 25% stake in the company, worth about $300 million.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>With Bloomberg L.P. revenues increasing to $8.3 billion in 2013, Charles Zegar quietly retains his spot on the World's Billionaires list, along with Michael Bloomberg and Thomas Secunda, fellow co-founders of the financial data giant. Despite the growth, the company has a tough road ahead as it navigates a rocky relationship with major growth market China -- which has bristled at some of the company's investigative news reports. Zegar earned his master's degree in computer science at NYU, then built the first software for Bloomberg's famous terminals. The low-profile son of a subway conductor was widowed young but remarried in 2001; he and second wife Merryl Snow Zegar are signatories of the Gates/Buffett Giving Pledge. They donate to Jewish causes and inner city education, among other interests, via their Zegar Family Foundation.</b_desc>

Bassam accused Kutayba and Omar in U.S. courts of hacking into his email to gain the upper hand in negotiations. In October 2011 a U.K. judge ruled that Kutayba and Omar may have orchestrated the hacking. In the U.S. a judge put the case on hold, pending arbitration in Kuwait.

      <b_desc>Indian-born property developer P.N.C.Menon, who became a citizen of Oman in 1997, re-enters the billionaire ranks based on new information about his holdings in the Middle East where he's developing villas, hotels and townships. He parlayed a small woodworking outfit that he started in the southern Indian state of Kerala into a real estate empire straddling India and the Middle East. In Oman, he started with interior decorations and went on to embellish palaces across the Middle East. He later moved into real estate, founding Sobha Developers, known for the futuristic campuses it has built for Bangalore tech firm Infosys, among much else. Listed in India, it is run by son Ravi. Menon, who lives in Dubai, says he plans to give away half his fortune though he hasn't signed the Giving Pledge.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Brian Roberts, Comcast's CEO and largest shareholder, returns to the billionaire ranks for the first time since 2001 as his broadband behemoth surges to new heights. Roberts made waves in early 2014 when Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, agreed to buy Time Warner Cable, the second largest, for $45 billion. The combined company would have even more national sway with content providers and local pricing power, but the deal must first pass through tricky regulatory hurdles. Roberts has built his company on bold acquisitions, most recently snapping up NBCUniversal from GE. Roberts' father Ralph co-founded Comcast in 1963 with the purchase of a 1,200-subscriber cable system in Tupelo, MS, and took it public in 1972. The younger Roberts had his first Comcast internship at age 15, then made a rapid rise through the company, becoming president in 1990 at age 31 and inheriting the majority of his father's stock in 1999. A Philadelphia native, Roberts received his B.S. from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was also an All-American in squash.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Remo Ruffini became a billionaire when Moncler, which sells puffy jackets for as much as $3,600, went public in December 2013. Ruffini was on the floor of the Milan exchange for the offering, and he watched as his company's stock jumped 47% on its opening day, reportedly making it the most successful European IPO of 2013. The stock is down slightly since, but Ruffini's 32% stake is still worth $1.3 billion (950 million euros). Two French climbers founded Moncler in 1954, and an Italian expedition took its coats to climb K2 the same year. By 2003 the brand had faded and Moncler was doing a reported $60 million (45 million euros) in sales a year. Ruffini, who had previously started two clothing companies of his own, bought Moncler for an undisclosed price. He added new colors and designs, and partnered with the Carlyle Group to expand internationally. By 2012 Moncler had $670 million (490 million euros) in revenue and stores in 66 countries.

He sits on the board of not only SapuraKencana but also telecom giant Maxis and fiber-optics cable company Opcom Holdings. He's a cornerstone investor in IHH Healthcare and Astro Malaysia Holdings. But he focuses on the sector he knows best, oil and gas, where he cut his teeth as a petroleum engineer out of college. In July 2013, when news of his investment in another oil-services company, Yinson Holdings, surfaced, its stock went on a tear.

He was new to the Forbes Billionaires list in 2013 when we valued his fortune at $2.2 billion. But new information about the company led us to compare it to multi-level marketing companies like Herbalife or direct sales companies like Oriflame, which are priced at much lower multiples than mainstream cosmetics firms like Brazil's Natura. Yanbal's sales have held steady in the past year. Fernando and younger brother Eduardo used to run a jointly-owned cosmetics firm before they dissolved their partnership in 1988. Fernando has since expanded the firm to Spain and other Latin American countries, with a large presence in Ecuador.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Dropbox cofounder and CEO Drew Houston is Silicon Valley's newest boy-wonder billionaire. Barely out of his 20s, he joins the 10-figure fortune club this year after his San Francisco-based tech company raised a new round of funding in Jan. 2014 at a valuation just under $10 billion. Houston (pronounced like the New York City street, not the Texas city) cofounded Dropbox, a cloud-based file-sharing service, with Arash Ferdowsi in 2007. Today, the company is the most valuable private technology company in the world, with rumors abound that it plans to file for an initial public offering in 2014. Investors include venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and Accel Partners as well as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. Houston started tinkering with computers at the age of 5 and has been involved in startups since high school. Dropbox is his sixth startup.</b_desc>

A descendant of Mormon pioneers in Utah, he grew up poor but hardworking, mowing lawns and picking potatoes for six cents a sack. Hue earned a degree from Wharton (though he hadn't heard of it before his recruitment interview), married a girl from his congregation and went to work for his in-laws' egg business. He expanded the company into making egg cartons through a joint venture with Dow Chemical. In 1982 he started Huntsman Chemical and showed he had the right chemistry to make deals, acquiring downtrodden businesses at cyclical lows with borrowed money in the junk-bond boom. In all, he purchased 34 companies. Perhaps the most notable: 1994's $1.06 billion deal for Texaco's petrochemicals operation. By the '90s he started focusing on donating his money. A two-time cancer survivor, he founded an institute to find a cure for the disease. He's also given money to Wharton and signed the Giving Pledge:</b_desc>

With its silver output declining, the company's share price has fallen more than 50% in the past 12 months as of mid-Feb. 2014, knocking $1 billion off Hochshild's net worth. The mining company has attempted to reverse its fortunes by purchasing the remaining 40% stakes it did not own of the Peruvian Pallancata mine and Immaculada Advanced Project from International Minerals Corporation. The company also sold $350 million in bonds in late 2013 to fund those projects. Hochschild's great uncle founded the Peruvian mining and cement-focused Hochschild Group in 1911. Today, Hochschild chairs both Hochschild Mining and Cementos Pacasmayo. Based in Lima, Hochschild Mining trades on the London Stock Exchange and operates gold and silver mines across North and South America. Cementos Pacasmayo, one of Peru's largest publicly traded cement companies, listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2012. In 1998 during a period of political unrest in Peru, Hochschild survived an attack by a gunman that claimed the life of his father.

      <b_desc>New billionaire Leonard Schleifer is one of just a handful of entrepreneurs to strike it rich in the pharmaceutical industry. The Regeneron founder and CEO has seen his company's share price increase nearly 180% over the last two years as of mid February. The Tarrytown, N.Y.-based company's success is due largely to Eylea, a treatment for age-related macular degeneration, which reached $1.9 billion in annual sales. New experimental medicines for high cholesterol, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are also nearing that market as part of a deal with drug giant Sanofi. Schleifer grew up in Queens, the son of a Depression-era sweater manufacturer who attended Cornell on scholarship and dreamed of a medical career but had to return to the family business. He followed his father's footsteps to Cornell and then got an M.D.-PhD degree at the University of Virginia, training with future Nobel Laureate Alfred Gilman. He returned to Cornell's New York Hospital to become a neurologist and a junior faculty member.</b_desc>

The siblings resolved the dispute in 2005 when they agreed to divide their assets with Antti maintaining control and an ownership stake in Kone, while the other siblings got a majority stake in Cargotec and a minority stake in Kone.

Still, the company, which operates resorts in Egypt, remains hard hit by the country's instability, with revenues declining more than 10% in the first half of last year.

The company's poor performance sealed his fate as CEO, and he stepped down in July 2013 to give way to Microsoft exec. Dan Mattrick. That move has done a world of good for Pincus' pockets as the company's shares are trading up nearly 50% year-over-year as of mid-Feb. 2014. Still serving as chairman and chief product officer, Pincus holds about 87 million shares in the San Francisco-based company, despite selling off about 16.5 million shares in April 2012. That move was widely-criticized as the company cofounder was able to sell, while employees were forced to hold on to their shares and subsequently subject to the stock's steep decline in the following months. Pincus' wife Alison cofounded One Kings Lane a flash sales site for home goods.</b_desc>

      <b_desc>Graham Kirkham, new to the list this year, created a fortune from furniture. The only son of a Yorkshire coal miner started with a job in a local furniture store. In 1969, at 25, he believed making furniture was relatively easy and by cutting out the warehouse dealers in the middle of the furniture supply chain he could sell direct to the public at cheaper prices. He rented a room above a snooker hall in Doncaster and began making furniture upstairs and selling it downstairs. The business, Northern Upholstery, became DFS and was floated on the London stock market in 1993. In 2004 he took the business private, and sold it to private equity firm Advent International in 2010. More recently, in 2012, Kirkham helped to fund his friend Malcolm Walker's $ 2.4 billion takeover of The Iceland food group and has invested in a fish and chip shop chain. A strong financial supporter of the Conservative Party, Kirkham was made a life peer as Baron Kirkham of Old Cantley in 1999 and sits in the House of Lords.

The oldest son of a truck driver and an Italian immigrant, Martins, a Mormon, started learning English through his church when he was 12, and vastly improved his language skills when he moved to the U.S. to attend Brigham Young University in Utah. Upon graduation, Martins returned to Brazil to work for a multinational paper company in a tiny city 200 miles from Sao Paulo. Coworkers started asking him to teach them English. Eventually, he was making more money teaching from his dining room table than at his full time job. He used all his savings to rent space for an English school. He expanded his Grupo Multi through franchises and turned it into the market leader in Brazil's booming language teaching industry, with over 2,600 franchised schools and more than 800,000 students. In 2010 he sold a 15% stake for $125 million to an arm of Brazilian bank Banco Itau. Then in December 2012 he sold his remaining stake in Grupo Multi to UK media and education company Pearson for $720 million in cash. He also owns real estate assets and a majority stake of Vale Presente, the only Brazilian non-bank institution authorized to issue Mastercard branded cards, plus has accumulated an estimated $200 million in dividends from Grupo Multi over the years.</b_desc>
